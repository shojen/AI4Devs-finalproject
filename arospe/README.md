Arospe is a Laravel + Livewire dashboard for managing a blog and an ecommerce operation (products, orders, taxes, and related entities). This README is aimed at a developer joining the team and covers everything needed to get the project running locally.

> The Tests/Lint badges above are live GitHub Actions status for the `feature-entrega2-ARP` branch — update the `branch=` query param (or drop it to track the repository's default branch) once this work merges. `.github/workflows/` lives at the git repository root (`../.github/workflows/`), not under `arospe/`, since GitHub Actions only discovers workflows there.

## Prerequisites

- **PHP** 8.3 or newer (only required if you run tooling outside of Docker; Sail provides PHP for you)
- **Composer**
- **Docker** (Docker Desktop) — used to run the local environment through Laravel Sail
- **Windows users must use WSL2.** Run all commands from inside your WSL2 (Ubuntu) shell, not from PowerShell or CMD.

## Local setup

Follow these steps in order.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd arospe
```

### 2. Create the `.env` file

Create a `.env` file at the project root. **The configuration values must be requested privately from Angel** — do not guess, invent, or reuse values from another environment. There is a `.env.example` in the repo showing which keys exist, but the working values (database credentials, app settings, etc.) come from Angel.

### 3. Install PHP dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### 4. Start the services with Sail

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```

### 5. Services started by Sail

The environment is defined in `compose.yaml`. Bringing it up starts the following services:

| Service | Image | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `laravel.test` | `sail-8.5/app` (built from `docker/8.5`) | The application container running PHP 8.5. Serves the app (port `80` by default) and the Vite dev server (port `5173`). |
| `mysql` | `mysql:8.4` | Primary database (port `3306` by default). Also provisions a separate testing database via `docker/mysql/create-testing-database.sh`. |
| `redis` | `redis:alpine` | Redis instance (port `6379` by default) for caching, sessions, and queues. |

> **Note for Windows users**
>
> - **WSL2 is required.** Clone the project and run every command from inside your WSL2 (Ubuntu) shell.
> - **Docker Desktop must be running (started)** before you bring up the services with `sail up`.
> - **Docker Desktop must have WSL2 integration enabled for the Ubuntu distro you are using.** Enable it under **Settings → Resources → WSL Integration** and toggle on your corresponding distro. Without this, `./vendor/bin/sail` cannot reach the Docker daemon.

### 6. Migrate and seed the database

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed
```

**Seeding is required, not optional.** `RolePermissionSeeder` is the only source of the application's roles and permission catalog (two roles, 42 permissions), so the app cannot authorize anything until it has run — this holds on every environment, deployments included. Locally, `--seed` also creates a `test@example.com` / `password` fixture account; that fixture is created **only** in `local` and `testing`, never in staging or production.

Optionally, set `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` in `.env` before seeding to bootstrap a Super Admin account. If it matches a registered, email-verified user, that user is granted the role; if it matches no account at all, the seeder creates one and emails a password-reset link so you can claim it. See [`docs/architecture/authorization.md`](docs/architecture/authorization/overview-catalog-seeding.md#super-admin-bootstrap) for all five branches, including the two that abort with an operator-facing error.

> **Accounts start `inactive`, and only an `active` account can sign in.** A newly registered user's `users.status` is `inactive` until their email is verified — completing Fortify's verification, setting a password from an invitation link, or confirming a pending email change all activate the account through the same listener. Until then, signing in is refused on **every** path (password, two-factor, passkey, remember-me) with "this account is not active", even though the credentials are correct; the one exception is the sign-in Fortify performs immediately after registration, which still works. So if a freshly created local account cannot log in, verify its email first (see the log-driver note below) rather than reaching for the password. Changing an email address never rewrites `users.email` on the spot: the new address is held as `pending_email` until the signed link sent to it is used. Mail runs on the `log` driver locally (`MAIL_MAILER=log`), so verification links show up in `storage/logs/laravel.log` — tail them with `sail artisan pail`. The email-change notification is queued and `QUEUE_CONNECTION=database`, so a worker has to be running (`composer dev`, or `sail artisan queue:work`) for the link to be written out at all. See [`docs/architecture/authentication.md`](docs/architecture/authentication/features-registration-and-status.md#account-status-and-activation), and [the sign-in block](docs/architecture/authentication/sign-in-block-and-email-change.md#sign-in-the-account-status-block) for where the status is enforced.

## Additional useful commands

All commands below run through Sail so they execute inside the container. If you have a local PHP/Composer/Node toolchain, you can drop the `./vendor/bin/sail` prefix where applicable.

### Frontend assets

Install and build (or watch) frontend assets:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail npm install
./vendor/bin/sail npm run dev      # Vite dev server with hot reload
./vendor/bin/sail npm run build    # Production build
```

### Database

Run migrations and seed the database (see [step 6](#6-migrate-and-seed-the-database) — seeding is required):

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate --seed
./vendor/bin/sail artisan db:seed
```

Rebuild the database from scratch:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

On a deployed environment, seed with the narrow form so that no local-only fixture seeder can ever be picked up:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=RolePermissionSeeder
```

A deployed environment also needs **one cron entry that runs Laravel's scheduler every minute**, or scheduled blog posts never go live (there is no error if it is missing). Add it once, as the user that runs the app — do not add a cron line per command:

```cron
* * * * * cd /path/to/arospe && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
```

Verify with `php artisan schedule:list`. See [architecture/overview.md](docs/architecture/overview.md#deployment-note).

### Tests

The suite uses Pest:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan test
```

There is also a Composer `test` script that clears config, checks formatting, runs static analysis, and then runs the suite:

```bash
composer test
```

#### Browser tests (one-time setup)

Real-browser end-to-end tests run through the Pest browser plugin, which drives Playwright. Before running them on a fresh machine or CI runner, download the browser binaries once (they are cached in `~/.cache/ms-playwright/`, not committed to the repo):

```bash
npx playwright install
```

On some Linux hosts a few system libraries needed by Firefox/WebKit may be missing; Chromium (the default) still works. To install the OS-level dependencies as well, use `sudo npx playwright install --with-deps`.

The `tests/Browser/` suite is wired into `phpunit.xml`, so a plain `php artisan test` runs it alongside `Unit` and `Feature` — which means the binaries above are a prerequisite for the **full** suite, not just for browser-specific runs. To skip them, run a single suite: `php artisan test --testsuite=Feature`. See [docs/testing/frontend/playwright-setup.md](docs/testing/frontend/playwright-setup.md) for the full status, including what CI covers (Chromium only).

### Code quality

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail composer lint          # Fix code style with Pint
./vendor/bin/sail composer lint:check    # Check style without modifying files
./vendor/bin/sail composer types:check   # Static analysis with Larastan
```

### Logs

Tail application logs with Pail:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan pail
```

### Stopping the environment

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail down
```
