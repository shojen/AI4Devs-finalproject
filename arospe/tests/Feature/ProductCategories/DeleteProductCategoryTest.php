// Story 0025 Phase 2 review, finding B-2: every test in this file must now seed the catalog and
// grant $this->actor `products.delete`, once story 0025's own D-B2 correction lands
// Gate::authorize('delete', ...) as DeleteProductCategory::__invoke()'s literal first
// statement. Until then $this->actor was a bare User::factory() with no seeded catalog and no
// permission, which passed only because the guard it exercises had no Gate call in front of it --
// once one exists, every test below would fail on an authorization refusal instead of the
// domain-invariant refusal it actually asserts, unless this seed/grant is in place. The Super
// Admin test further down deliberately seeds a second time inside its own test body rather than
// relying on this beforeEach (Phase 5 review finding N-12) -- RolePermissionSeeder's two
// firstOrCreate*Role() entry points make that second run a no-op, not a collision.

// Story 0023 created this file; story 0024b (D-14) extended it with the in-use
// hard-block-with-count guard, once products.product_category_id exists. Every test below --
// the four regression cases and the new block/no-confirm-and-proceed/race cases -- now runs
// actingAs() an actor, per the story's own test-setup requirement: DeleteProductCategory does
// not itself authorize (D-B1).
//
// Corrected at Phase 5 review, finding B-2: this banner previously claimed "0025 will add a
// Gate::authorize() call above this guard without changing any of these tests" -- true only
// under the PRE-Phase-4-correction reading (gate in the calling component). Under the corrected
// D-B2 (the gate goes INSIDE DeleteProductCategory itself), every test in this file that reaches
// the guard runs through a real Gate::denies() check against an unseeded permission catalog --
// $this->actor here is a bare User::factory() with no role and no seeded permissions, so once
// the gate exists it will either throw PermissionDoesNotExist (catalog unseeded) or a genuine
// AuthorizationException, not the ValidationException these tests assert on today. 0025 MUST
// seed RolePermissionSeeder and grant products.delete to $this->actor in this file's beforeEach
// (the Super Admin test below already does the former for its own actor, deliberately inside
// its own test body rather than in beforeEach -- Phase 5 review finding N-12 -- so 0025's fix is
// one seed call moved up, not new).
