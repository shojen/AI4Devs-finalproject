 * a failure never leaves an orphaned file behind.
 *
 * `$generateImageConversions` and `$logRefusedPrivilegedAttempt` are both
 * constructor-injected rather than method-injected: `__invoke()`'s parameter
 * list is a public contract every caller (the Livewire component, and every
 * direct-call test) matches verbatim, so this action's own dependencies go
 * in the constructor instead of widening that signature -- the same

 * follows (docs/conventions/code-style.md).
