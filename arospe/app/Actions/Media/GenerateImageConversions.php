     * correct and idempotent rather than something to cache or call once.
     *
     * WIDTH/HEIGHT are capped in pixels at MAX_DIMENSION so an oversized
     * image is refused at header-parse time, before any pixel buffer is
     * allocated. AREA is *also* a pixel-count resource -- not a byte one,
     * despite its name reading like the others -- and is capped at
     * MAX_DIMENSION^2, matching WIDTH x HEIGHT already being capped
     * individually (task 0019a; see docs/errors-log.md). MEMORY/MAP are the
     * genuinely byte-based resources and are capped at
     * MAX_DIMENSION^2 x BYTES_PER_PIXEL_CEILING -- generous enough for a
     * legitimate MAX_DIMENSION x MAX_DIMENSION image at this build's
     * worst-case bytes-per-pixel, while still refusing a decompression bomb
     * whose header claims a byte cost far beyond that (e.g. an animated
     * image whose every frame is individually within the WIDTH/HEIGHT/AREA
     * caps but whose cumulative decoded size is not). DISK is 0 so a
     * refused decode fails fast rather than spilling gigabytes of pixel
     * cache to disk first. TIME is a wall-clock backstop.
     *
     * Task 0019a note: on a host whose ImageMagick ships a restrictive
     * policy.xml (e.g. Debian/Ubuntu's packaged ImageMagick 6, which is what
     * this project's own Sail image installs), `setResourceLimit()` can only
     * *tighten* a resource below the policy's own ceiling -- it silently
     * clamps a request that exceeds it, with no error. Requesting the byte
     * ceiling for AREA (a pixel resource) previously asked for a value far
     * above the policy's pixel ceiling on that host, which happened to still
     * be silently accepted-and-clamped rather than throw, but was
     * conceptually wrong regardless of which host runs it.
     *
     * Task 0019a Phase 4 finding F-1: ImageMagick's AREA check is a STRICT
     * `<` against the limit (verified: AREA == MAX_DIMENSION^2 refuses an
     * exactly-MAX_DIMENSION x MAX_DIMENSION image; AREA == MAX_DIMENSION^2+1
     * admits it), so the limit itself must be one pixel *above* the largest
     * legitimate area, not equal to it -- otherwise a legal upload at
     * exactly the dimension ceiling is refused, contradicting
     * MediaValidationRules::imageUploadRules()'s inclusive `dimensions:`
     * rule. `+ 1` is the fix, not a wider margin: WIDTH/HEIGHT already cap
     * every dimension individually, so MAX_DIMENSION^2 is the true
     * ceiling and one pixel of headroom is exactly what "greater than the
     * largest legal value" requires.
