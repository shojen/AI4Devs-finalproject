 * exercises; `update` (media.edit, story 0020) and `delete` (media.delete,
 * unused -- D11) are seeded ahead of their consumers and are correct from
 * the start rather than skipped, matching this catalog's normal state (see
 * docs/architecture/authorization/overview-catalog-seeding.md#permission-catalog). Neither `update`
 * nor `delete` branches on its `$target` -- there is no target-dependent
 * rule in this domain today, the same shape SalesRegionPolicy::update()
 * already established.
 *
 * `hasPermissionTo()` inside a policy body is correct even though it does
 * not itself reach `Gate::before` -- a policy method is only ever reached
 * *through* the Gate, and a Super Admin actor is granted before the policy
 * is consulted at all.
