/**
 * Authorization for role management -- the layer 0009/0011's dashboard
 * screens call via `authorize()`. Two tiers are refused independently of
 * the general `roles.manage` permission, in this order:
 *
 * 1. The Super Admin role is refused for `update()`/`delete()`
 *    categorically, identified via the hydration-safe, row-shaped
 *    `Role::isSuperAdminRoleRow()` (never `$role->name === ...` directly --
 *    see that method's own docblock for why a partially-hydrated or
 *    mid-rename row must still answer correctly).
 * 2. The seeded `Administrator` role requires the distinct
 *    `roles.manage-administrators` permission on top of `roles.manage`,
 *    identified via `Role::isAdministratorRole()` -- the same row-shaped
 *    helper story 0008a centralizes for the *user* side
 *    (`UserPolicy`, `CreateUser`, `UpdateUser`). Both helpers live on
 *    `App\Models\Role`; this policy defines no comparison of its own.
 *
 * This is a *complement* to, not a substitute for, `App\Models\Role`'s own
 * guards: `AppServiceProvider::configureAuthorization()`'s `Gate::before`
 * closure defers (returns `null`) rather than short-circuiting `true`
 * whenever the check's own target is the Super Admin role, so a Super
 * Admin actor's own `update()`/`delete()` attempt against their role
 * reaches this policy -- and is refused by it -- like any other actor's
 * would. The model-level guard still refuses the mutation too (defense in
 * depth) if this layer is ever bypassed (e.g. a code path that mutates
 * without calling `authorize()`). See tests/Feature/Policies/RolePolicyTest.php.

     * (ImmutableRoleException::render() matches a policy refusal), so the
     * behaviour is correct, but a story-0011 per-row Gate::allows() UI hint
