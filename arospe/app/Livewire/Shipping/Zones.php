 * Story 0034. `ShippingZonePolicy` (story 0033) gains its first real call
 * site here -- every action already self-authorizes (0033 Phase 4 finding
 * F-1), so every gate call in this class is a SECOND layer, matching this
 * project's "the component authorizing too is defence in depth, not
 * duplication" convention (see docs/conventions/base-standards.md).
 *
 * D-5: row actions gate on SCREEN-LEVEL capability flags (`canCreate()`
 * `canEdit()` `canDelete()`), never per-row `Gate::allows()` -- unlike
 * UserPolicy, ShippingZonePolicy carries no per-target rule at all (its
 * `update()`/`delete()` ignore `$target` entirely), so a screen-level flag
 * says exactly as much as N per-row checks and costs one evaluation instead
 * of N.
