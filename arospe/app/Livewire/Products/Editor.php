     * `withTranslationsFor()` eager-loads only the default language (R-4). A category with no
     * default-language translation renders `—` and sorts last, matching
     * ProductCategories\Index::loadProductCategories()'s identical convention, rather than
     * throwing or being silently omitted from the dropdown.
     *
     * Ordering runs through the shared App\Actions\Translations\CompareTranslatedNames (Phase 5
     * round-1 finding 2) instead of a bare `$nameA <=> $nameB` byte comparison, so this dropdown
     * keeps the case-/accent-insensitive ordering `orderBy('name')` gave it under the column's
     * `utf8mb4_unicode_ci` collation before the name moved off the table -- see that class and
     * ProductCategories\Index::loadProductCategories() for the shared reasoning. Resolved with
     * `app()` since no `#[Computed]` method in this codebase takes a typed, Livewire-injected
     * parameter.
