/**
 * Backoffice Roles & Permissions management screen: create, rename and
 * delete custom roles, and sync each role's per-module permission set.
 *
 * Class name and namespace are shared with sibling story 0011, which owns
 * the paired Blade view (resources/views/livewire/roles.blade.php) and the
 * component's UI-state properties; this story owns every query, mutation,
 * validation rule and authorization decision. Access is gated on
 * `roles.manage` (route middleware, `mount()`), with `App\Policies\RolePolicy`
 * re-checked as the first statement of every method that mutates or
 * discloses — Livewire 4's `PersistentMiddleware` allowlist does not carry
 * Spatie's `permission:` middleware, so route middleware alone does not
 * protect `/livewire/update` round-trips. See docs/architecture/authorization.md.
 *
 * Every role resolution and the listing below are scoped to
 * `guard_name = 'web'`, matching the validation rules in
 * App\Concerns\RoleValidationRules -- story 0010 Phase 4 security audit
 * finding F5: this app defines only the `web` guard today, so this is
 * defense in depth rather than a live gap, but leaving resolution unscoped
 * while validation is scoped would let a rename pass validation and then
 * hit the composite unique index as a raw, unhandled 23000.
