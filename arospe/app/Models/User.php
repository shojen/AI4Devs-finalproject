     * Soft-delete the user, obfuscating their email address first.
     *
     * Frees the original (and any still-pending) address for reuse by a new
     * user and prevents the outstanding pending-email confirmation link from
     * writing a live address back onto a trashed row. The placeholder is
     * anchored to the immutable UUID `id`, so it is collision-proof and
     * reproduces identically if a restored user is deleted again.
     *
     * The `! $this->exists` guard is required: without it, a non-persisted
     * instance's delete() (including the one forceDelete() calls internally,
     * per SoftDeletes) would run saveQuietly() against a model with no row,
     * phantom-inserting an obfuscated user instead of doing nothing.
     *
     * forceDelete() routes through this method (SoftDeletes calls delete()
     * internally when force-deleting), so a hard delete also pays for this
     * obfuscation write immediately before the row is physically removed.
     * That is wasteful but harmless — the row is gone either way — and is
     * left as-is rather than special-cased.
     *
     * Known limitation: a restored user (via SoftDeletes::restore(), which
     * this app has no call site for yet) keeps the obfuscated email. A future
     * restore flow must have the administrator re-enter the address, which
     * — per story 0003 — goes through the pending-email confirmation flow.
     *
     * Also revokes any outstanding `password_reset_tokens` row bound to the
     * account's real (pre-obfuscation) `email`. That table is keyed purely by
     * the email string, with no foreign key to `users`, so freeing the
     * address for reuse without also deleting the token would let a
     * still-valid reset link (issued to the deleted user, or to the
     * administrator on their behalf via App\Actions\Users\CreateUser's
     * invitation) resolve against whichever new account later claims the
     * recycled address within the token's window — an account takeover of
     * that new owner (see docs/errors-log.md). `pending_email` needs no
     * equivalent cleanup: it is never looked up by Fortify's password broker
     * (only `email` is), and its own verification link is a signed URL, not a
     * `password_reset_tokens` row, so no stale reference to it can exist in
     * that table.
     *
     * This override only fires on instance deletion — `$user->delete()` (and
     * `$user->forceDelete()`, which routes through it per SoftDeletes) both go
     * through Eloquent and hit this method. A bulk `User::where(...)->delete()`
     * via the query builder bypasses the model entirely and so skips this
     * override completely, leaving the affected rows' emails un-obfuscated and
     * any outstanding `password_reset_tokens` rows live — never use bulk
     * delete against `users`.
