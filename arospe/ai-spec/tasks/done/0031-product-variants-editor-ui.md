# [0031] Product variants — the variant builder inside the product editor (UI)

## Description
Build the **variant builder** embedded in [0027](../done/0027-products-list-and-editor-ui.md)'s routed product
editor: a list of the product's existing variants and a form that composes one attribute-value
combination at a time, each variant carrying its **live-previewed, read-only, derived SKU**, its own
price and stock, and an **optional** own image picked through the shared media gallery
([0020](../done/0020-shared-media-gallery-modal-ui.md), single-select) that falls back to the parent product's
featured image when unset.

It is **frontend only**: no migration, no model, no action, no policy, no validation rule. Every one of
those is consumed as already-shipped code from [0029](../done/0029-product-variants-backend.md) (variant
persistence, the SKU derivation, the duplicate-combination rule, read-time image inheritance) and
[0028](../done/0028-product-attribute-types-and-values-backend.md) (the attribute taxonomy). Building every
combination at once, against
**[0029b](../done/0029b-product-variant-combination-generator-backend.md)**'s cartesian generator, ships as
the follow-on story **[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)** — see the 2026-09-06 amendment
below.

> 🟠 **Amendment — 2026-09-04: this story's backend dependency is now three stories, and two of its
> standing assumptions about them are false.** [0029](../done/0029-product-variants-backend.md) **failed Phase 2
> INVEST on "Small"** and was split into **0029** (core: the tables, the derived SKU, the combination
> hash, image inheritance, the three single-variant actions),
> **[0029a](../done/0029a-attribute-in-use-delete-guards-backend.md)** (the two attribute in-use delete
> guards) and **[0029b](../done/0029b-product-variant-combination-generator-backend.md)** (the cartesian
> generator). **Nothing was cancelled or deferred** — the same code ships, in three sequenced stories.
> Three consequences for this file, each of which contradicts text below that has **not** been
> rewritten line by line and should be read against this note:
>
> 1. **The generator is 0029b's, not 0029's.** Every reference below that cites *"0029 D-18"* or
>    *"0029's generator"* — in **D-17**, in the superseded **D-3**, in the 2026-08-19 amendment table,
>    and in **OQ-2**'s resolution — means
>    **[0029b](../done/0029b-product-variant-combination-generator-backend.md)**'s **D-G1**–**D-G8**, which
>    carry 0029's D-18.1–D-18.7 renumbered and unchanged. The action's name is unchanged and is still
>    **`GenerateProductVariantCombinations`**.
> 2. 🔴 **This story is no longer the variant actions' "only enforcement path".** This paragraph used
>    to end: *"This story is where 0029's eleven zero-call-site deliverables — **four** actions
>    (`CreateProductVariant`, `UpdateProductVariant`, `DeleteProductVariant`,
>    `GenerateProductVariantCombinations`), `ProductVariant`, `VariantSku`, `VariantCombination`, and
>    `ProductPolicy`'s newly-widened coverage — acquire their **only** caller and their **only**
>    enforcement path."* 0029's **D-12.1** (decided at Phase 2) makes **all four actions
>    self-authorizing**, against the parent product, via `LogRefusedPrivilegedAttempt`. This story's
>    own gates are therefore **defence in depth** — still required in every method that mutates *or*
>    discloses, still what fails fast before a transaction opens and what makes the per-row UI hints
>    honest, but no longer the only layer. Part (a) of 0029's hand-off to this story is discharged at
>    the action; parts (b) `can:products.view` and (c) the read-only SKU are unchanged and still this
>    story's alone.
> 3. **Two class names changed.** `VariantSku` and `VariantCombination` were specified under an
>    unapproved new `app/Support/` base folder; they ship as
>    **`App\Actions\Products\DeriveVariantSku`** and **`App\Actions\Products\HashVariantCombination`**,
>    invokable and container-resolved. This story calls neither directly (the SKU preview is 0029's
>    derivation rendered read-only), but any reference to the old names below is stale.
>
> Sequencing: **0029 → 0029a → 0029b → 0031.** The generator UI (**D-17**) cannot start before 0029b
> reaches Phase 7, and the rest of this story cannot start before 0029 does.
>
> 🟠 **Note appended 2026-09-06, not a rewrite of the above.** Point 1's cross-references to **D-17** are
> now moot for *this file* — see the amendment immediately below, which moves the whole generator UI out
> of this story. The text above is left exactly as it stood, per this project's audit-authored-page
> convention of correcting in place rather than silently rewriting.

> 🔴 **Amendment — 2026-09-06: this story FAILED Phase 2 INVEST on "Small" and was split in two.**
> `code-reviewer`'s Phase 2 review bundled two conceptually separable units into one story: the
> single-variant builder (**D-1**–**D-16**, ~28 Gherkin scenarios, 6 test files) and the cartesian
> generator UI (the old **D-17** and its five subsections, its own modal/axis-picker/summary/pagination,
> a dedicated test file with 15 cases, 2 dedicated browser cases, 5 of ~20 acceptance-criteria bullets, 4
> dedicated false-pass entries, a whole Gherkin feature of 12 scenarios) — the exact shape that made
> **0029 fail "Small" and split into 0029/0029a/0029b**, and the generator half of *that* split (0029b)
> is the same feature the old **D-17** rendered a UI for. This story is now two:
>
> | Story | Scope |
> | --- | --- |
> | **0031** *(this file)* | the single-variant builder: the nested child component, the composed
> attribute-value repeater, the live server-computed SKU preview, refusal rendering, image inheritance,
> authorization, and the variants list (now paginated — see **D-17** below, kept here) |
> | **[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)** | the cartesian generator UI — the old **D-17**,
> **D-17.1**–**D-17.4** in full and the generator-specific tail of **D-17.5**, moved verbatim, sequenced
> immediately after this story ships |
>
> **What moved to 0031a, wholesale**: the "Generating every combination at once" Gherkin feature (12
> scenarios); the old **D-17** and subsections **D-17.1**–**D-17.4**; `GenerateProductVariantCombinations`
> from the confirmed action surface (the other three actions' signatures stay here — relocated to the new
> **[D-13a](#d-13a--the-confirmed-action-surface-this-component-calls-single-variant-actions)**, which
> also fixes a stale quoted `UpdateProductVariant` default `code-reviewer` flagged: the real shipped
> signature at `app/Actions/Products/UpdateProductVariant.php:57` carries `?string $featuredMediaId` with
> **no** default, not `= null`); the `attributeTypeIds` row from **D-8**'s bag-key table; the
> `products.variants.generate.*` **control** translation keys from **D-15** (0029b's own **outcome**

> `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderGeneratorTest.php`; browser cases **B9**/**B10**; every

>
> **What was kept here, trimmed, because it is not generator-specific**: the old **D-17.4**'s pagination
> decision (`->paginate(25)`, the total-order tiebreak, `#[Computed]` still holding) is **not** a

> own copy of **D-17.5** references it rather than re-arguing it.
>
> 🔴 **D-10 corrected in the same pass.** It read *"this story is 0029's only enforcement path"* —
> contradicted by this file's own 2026-09-04 amendment note above (point 2), which already states 0029's
> **D-12.1** makes all four variant actions self-authorizing and this story's gates are **defence in

>
> **D-3 restored as this story's live scope fence.** The 2026-08-19 amendment superseded **D-3** because
> the generator briefly shipped as part of this story; that in-scope period is now superseded a **second**
> time — the generator UI moves to 0031a, so **D-3**'s original fence (*"no cartesian generator UI in

> Nothing about the single-variant builder's own decisions (**D-1**–**D-16**, **D-16a**) changed in this
> split — only their neighbours did.

> 🔴 **The single most important fact about this screen, and the one most likely to be built wrong:
> a variant's SKU is not an input.** 0029 was substantially redesigned on 2026-08-18
> ([its D-4](../done/0029-product-variants-backend.md#d-4--sku-is-derived-from-the-parent-products-sku-and-the-variants-attribute-values)):
> the SKU is **computed** as `{product.sku}` followed by each attribute value with whitespace runs
> collapsed to a single hyphen and casing preserved, appended in
> `(type.position, type.id, value.position, value.id)` order. `0001` + Talla `M` → `0001-M`;
> `0002` + Color `azul marino` + Talla `L` → `0002-azul-marino-L`. There is **no SKU field**, no
> disabled input, no hidden field, and no public property named `sku` on this component. The builder
> **previews** the value live as the administrator picks values, and **displays** the stored value for
> saved variants — two different sources that must never be confused ([D-4](#d-4--the-live-sku-preview-is-a-server-side-computed-never-a-property-and-never-client-side)).

## Type
frontend | fullstack (related_task_id: **0029** — product variants backend, whose paired UI this is) |
includes database-expert: **no**

No schema change, no migration, no index decision, no new query shape beyond two eager loads over
tables 0029 designed. `database-expert` is therefore not convened, matching
[0025](../done/0025-product-categories-ui.md)'s and [0027](../done/0027-products-list-and-editor-ui.md)'s precedent for
the sibling screens.

> 🟣 **The classification was never generator-driven, and the 2026-09-06 split leaves it exactly where
> it stood before the generator ever entered this file.** [OQ-2](#open-questions)'s history records that
> the cartesian generator was briefly in scope here (2026-08-19) with no database consequence of its own
> — every database-shaped piece of it (the batch transaction and its savepoints, the `MAX_COMBINATIONS`
> cap, the one-query duplicate pre-read, the lock-hold window) landed in **0029**/0029b, never in a
> Livewire component. Now that the generator's **UI** has also moved out, to
> **[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)**, this section has nothing left to argue: this story
> calls three already-specified single-variant actions and renders their results. **No new table,
> column, index, migration, seeder or query shape is introduced here.**
>
> The one UI-side consequence the generator's brief residency left behind is **pagination** — needed the
> moment a product accumulates more than ~25 variants, generator or not — decided in this file's own
> **[D-17](#d-17--pagination-kept-from-the-old-d-174-because-it-is-not-generator-specific)**, a Livewire/
> Blade decision, not a database one. `0031` stays **`includes database-expert: no`**; `0029`'s `yes`
> does not propagate across the FE/BE pair, and never has (0024/0027 and 0028/0030 are the same shape).

**Hard dependency chain, longer than `related_task_id` suggests.** This story cannot start until
🟠 **0019 → 0020 → 0021 → 0022 → 0023 → 0024 → 0026 → 0027 → 0028 → 0029 → 0029a → 0030** are
all closed, stated as a permutation rather than a range on purpose, per
[workflow.md](../../../docs/workflow.md#task-ordering-rule)'s range-notation warning.
`related_task_id` correctly names the FE/BE pair (0029); 0027 and 0020 are hard blockers from other
pairs, and 0028/0030 supply the taxonomy this screen reads.
**[0029a](../done/0029a-attribute-in-use-delete-guards-backend.md)** blocks nothing here directly; it is in
the chain because it edits 0028's shipped code that this screen's sibling (0030) renders.
🔴 **`0029b` is no longer in this chain at all** — the 2026-09-06 split moved its only consumer
(the generator UI) to **[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)**, which names 0029b as its own
hard blocker instead. This is the **last** story of Epic 2's products arc that ships the single-variant
builder; 0031a, sequenced immediately after it, is the true last link.

## Three Amigos participants

`product-owner` (lead) + `frontend-expert` (files and approach) + `frontend-qa` (test design), per
[workflow.md](../../../docs/workflow.md#phase-1--three-amigos-debate)'s
[task classification rule](../../../docs/workflow.md#task-classification-rule).

Both specialists were convened as subagents and **both delivered in full**, each executing its claims
against this repository rather than reasoning about them — every **V-** finding below is a command
result. `product-owner` then reconciled the two contributions, which **converged on every major
decision but split on one** ([D-2](#d-2--the-combination-is-composed-in-a-keyed-repeater-of-paired-selects-the-one-place-the-two-specialists-split)),
and contributed three findings of its own. See [Provenance](#provenance) for exactly which role covered
what.

## PRD coverage

Derived from [PRD §2.2 Products](../../../docs/PRD/PRD.md#22-products)' *"Product variants (extends the
prototype)"* Gherkin block and [§2.3](../../../docs/PRD/PRD.md#23-shared-media-gallery). This story is the
**screen half** of scenarios whose data half [0029](../done/0029-product-variants-backend.md) already owns:

| PRD scenario / criterion | Owned here |
| --- | --- |
| *Create a variant as an attribute combination* → **"that variant has its own SKU, price, and stock"** | the builder's create form, the live SKU preview, and the rendered variants list. 0029 owns the persistence and the derivation. |
| *A variant without its own image inherits the parent's featured image* → **"When the variant is displayed"** | the rendered inheritance, including the badge that distinguishes it from an own image. The PRD's `When` is literally a *display* verb, so this scenario is **only** satisfiable here. |
| *A variant with its own image uses that image* | same. |
| *A duplicate attribute combination is rejected* | the builder rendering the refusal legibly. 0029 owns the rule. |
| Products AC 3 (*"each variant combination has its own SKU/price/stock and an optional image that inherits the parent's"*) — **rendered** | the whole story. |
| Products AC 4 (*"duplicate variant combinations are rejected"*) — **rendered** | the refusal's visibility. |
| §2.3 / Products AC 6 (*"product and variant images come from the shared media gallery"*) — **rendered** | the fourth `media.gallery` embed on the editor page. |

> 🔴 **The cartesian generator's own "not PRD-derived" discussion moved to
> [0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md#prd-coverage) in the 2026-09-06 split** — it is a PO
> decision taken on 2026-08-19, above the PRD rather than out of it, and its story is the one that now
> ships the twelve *"Generating every combination at once"* scenarios. §2.2's only creation scenario
> remains singular, which is why 0031a's own PRD coverage section states the generator is scope the PO
> added rather than a rendering of existing PRD text.

**Not covered here** (each names its owner): the derivation formula, the combination hash, the
collision matrix, the referential-integrity FKs and the two attribute in-use guards (**0029**); the
cartesian generator's UI, and its own outcome semantics/transaction shape/batch cap
(**[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)** / **0029b**); the
attribute taxonomy screen (**0030**); the product's own fields, list and delete (**0027**); the gallery's
own mechanics (**0019**/**0020**).

## Gherkin

Every scenario opens with a named business-role actor and carries exactly one `When`, per
[gherkin-guidelines.md](../../../docs/testing/frontend/gherkin-guidelines.md) rules 1 and 3. Glossary terms
(**attribute type**, **attribute value**, **combination**, **variant**, **derived SKU**, **catalog
administrator**) are taken from 0028/0029/0030; none is invented.

```gherkin
Feature: Building a product's variants

  Scenario: A single-attribute variant is listed with its derived SKU
    Given a catalog administrator editing the product "Camiseta" with the SKU "0001", with the attribute type Talla in the catalog
    When they add the variant for the Talla value "M"
    Then the variant is listed with the SKU "0001-M"

  Scenario: A multi-attribute variant reads in the attribute types' own configured order
    Given a catalog administrator editing the product "Pantalón" with the SKU "0002", with the attribute types ordered Acabado, Talla then Color
    When they add the variant for Acabado "Mate", Talla "L" and Color "azul marino"
    Then the variant is listed with the SKU "0002-Mate-L-azul-marino"

  Scenario: The order the values are chosen in does not change the derived SKU
    Given a catalog administrator editing the product "Pantalón" with the SKU "0002", with the attribute types ordered Acabado, Talla then Color
    When they add the variant choosing Color "azul marino" first, then Acabado "Mate", then Talla "L"
    Then the variant is listed with the SKU "0002-Mate-L-azul-marino"

  Scenario: The derived SKU is previewed before the variant is added
    Given a catalog administrator editing the product "Camiseta" with the SKU "0001", with the attribute type Talla in the catalog
    When they choose the Talla value "M"
    Then the SKU "0001-M" is previewed beside the combination

  Scenario: The preview shows the same transliteration the catalog will store
    Given a catalog administrator editing the product "Pantalón" with the SKU "0002", with the attribute type Color in the catalog
    When they choose the Color value "Marrón"
    Then the SKU "0002-Marron" is previewed

  Scenario: An empty combination previews no SKU
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product, with no attribute value chosen yet
    When they open the variant form
    Then no SKU is previewed and a placeholder is shown in its place

  Scenario: The administrator is never offered a SKU to type
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product that offers attribute types
    When they open the variant form
    Then the derived SKU is shown as read-only text and no SKU field is offered

  Scenario: A newly added variant is listed with the SKU the catalog stored
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product, with the previewed SKU on screen
    When they add that variant
    Then the listed SKU is the one recorded in the catalog rather than the previewed text

  Scenario: A variant's price is pre-filled from the product
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product priced at 119.95 EUR
    When they open the variant form
    Then the variant's price is pre-filled with 119.95

  Scenario: A product with no variants explains itself
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product that holds no variants
    When they open that product's editor
    Then an empty state is shown instead of an empty variants table

  Scenario: Variants are unavailable until the product exists
    Given a catalog administrator creating a brand-new product
    When they open the product editor
    Then the variant builder is replaced by a notice that the product must be saved first

  Scenario: A catalog with no attribute types explains the dead end
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product, with no attribute types defined in the catalog
    When they open that product's editor
    Then the builder explains that attribute types must be defined first and offers a way to reach them

Feature: Refusing a variant the catalog cannot accept

  Scenario: A duplicate attribute combination is refused
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product that already holds the variant "Talla M"
    When they add the combination "Talla M" to that same product again
    Then the save is refused with a duplicate-combination message and the product still holds one "Talla M" variant

  Scenario: A combination whose derived SKU a product already uses is refused
    Given a catalog administrator editing the product "0001", with another product in the catalog using the SKU "0001-M"
    When they add the variant for the Talla value "M"
    Then the save is refused with a message naming the product that holds that SKU

  Scenario: Two attribute values that reduce to the same SKU segment are refused
    Given a catalog administrator editing the product "0002" that already holds the Color "azul marino" variant
    When they add the variant for the Color value "azul-marino"
    Then the save is refused with a message naming the SKU both values produce

  Scenario: An attribute value that reduces to nothing is refused by name
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product, with an attribute type holding the value "★"
    When they add the variant for the value "★"
    Then the save is refused with a message naming that attribute value

  Scenario: A refusal names a remedy the administrator can act on
    Given a catalog administrator whose variant was refused for a SKU already in use
    When they read the refusal
    Then it names the conflicting record and tells them to change the product's SKU or rename the attribute value

  Scenario Outline: A refused variant leaves the catalog untouched
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product, arranged so that <refusal> will occur
    When they add the offending variant
    Then no variant and no attribute combination is recorded against that product

    Examples:
      | refusal                                |
      | a duplicate combination                |
      | a derived SKU a product already holds  |
      | an attribute value reducing to nothing |
      | a derived SKU longer than the limit    |

Feature: A variant's image

  Scenario: A variant with no image of its own shows the product's featured image
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product with a featured image, holding a variant that has no image of its own
    When they open that product's variants
    Then that variant shows the product's featured image marked as inherited

  Scenario: Changing the product's featured image changes what an inheriting variant shows
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product whose variant has no image of its own
    When they choose a different featured image for the product
    Then that variant shows the product's new featured image

  Scenario: A variant with its own image keeps it when the product's featured image changes
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product whose variant has its own image
    When they choose a different featured image for the product
    Then that variant still shows its own image

  Scenario: An image chosen for one variant does not reach another
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product holding the variants "Talla M" and "Talla L"
    When they choose an image from the media gallery for "Talla L"
    Then "Talla L" shows that image and "Talla M" is unchanged

  Scenario: An own image is reverted to the product's
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product whose variant has its own image
    When they revert that variant to the product's image
    Then the variant shows the product's featured image marked as inherited

  Scenario: An administrator without the media view permission still reaches the builder
    Given a signed-in catalog administrator who may edit products but may not view the media library
    When they open a product's variants
    Then the builder renders with the image picker shown disabled and an explanation

Feature: Changing and removing a variant

  Scenario: A variant's combination cannot be changed once it exists
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product that holds the variant "Talla M"
    When they open that variant to edit it
    Then its price, stock and image are editable and its attribute combination is shown as fixed

  Scenario: Removing a variant asks for confirmation naming it
    Given a catalog administrator editing a product that holds the variant "Talla M"
    When they choose to remove that variant
    Then a confirmation naming "Talla M" and its SKU is shown and the variant is still listed

  Scenario: The removal confirmation states that it cannot be undone
    Given a catalog administrator who has chosen to remove a variant
    When they read the confirmation
    Then it states that the removal is permanent

  Scenario: A removed combination can be built again immediately
    Given a catalog administrator who has just removed the "Talla M" variant from the product "0001"
    When they add the combination "Talla M" to that product again
    Then the variant is listed with the SKU "0001-M"

Feature: Permission to manage a product's variants

  Scenario: An administrator without the products view permission cannot open the editor
    Given a signed-in administrator who does not hold the products view permission
    When they request a product's editor
    Then access is refused

  Scenario: An administrator without the products edit permission cannot add a variant
    Given a signed-in administrator who does not hold the products edit permission
    When they submit a new variant for a product
    Then the submission is refused and the product holds no new variant

  Scenario: An administrator without the products edit permission cannot remove a variant
    Given a signed-in administrator who does not hold the products edit permission
    When they submit the removal of a variant
    Then the removal is refused and the variant is still in the catalog

  Scenario: A variant belonging to another product cannot be removed through this product's editor
    Given a catalog administrator permitted to edit the product "Camiseta" but not the product "Pantalón"
    When they submit the removal of a "Pantalón" variant from the "Camiseta" editor
    Then the removal is refused and that variant still belongs to "Pantalón"

  Scenario: An action the administrator may not perform is shown disabled
    Given a signed-in administrator who holds the products view permission but not the products edit permission
    When they open a product's variants
    Then each variant's remove action is shown disabled with an explanation

### D-1 — The builder is a **nested child component**, not part of `Editor` and not its own route

`App\Livewire\Products\VariantBuilder`, embedded in
`resources/views/livewire/products/editor.blade.php`, rendered only when a product exists. Four shapes
were weighed; the verdict is **not close**, and the deciding argument is a correctness one rather than
an aesthetic one.

| | ✅ **(A) Nested child** | (B) Properties on `Editor` | (C) Own route `products/{product}/variants` | (D) A Livewire island |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Error bag** | **Separate bag.** No field on this component binds `sku`, so nothing mis-renders | 🔴 **Broken by construction** — see below | Separate | 🔴 Same bag as (B); an island scopes *rendering*, not the error bag |
| **Unsaved product edits** | ✅ survive a builder round-trip | ✅ survive | 🔴 **lost on navigation** | ✅ survive |
| **Re-render cost** | only the child re-renders per value pick | 🔴 the whole editor re-renders — three galleries, the WYSIWYG and the region picker included | n/a | partially mitigated |
| **`Editor` size** | unchanged (0027 already calls its own test file "the largest file") | 🔴 ~25 properties, ~25 methods, 4 embedded children, 5 selects | small | 🔴 as (B) |
| **Route / docs cost** | **none** | none | one route + middleware + `docs/api/routes.md` | none |
| **New idiom** | none — nested children are the house pattern (0020, 0021, 0022 are all embedded children) | none | none | 🔴 the codebase's **first** island (**FE-V6**: zero usages today) |

**Why (B) is a real bug and not merely inelegant.** **FE-V4** verifies that `flux:select`'s and
`flux:input`'s stubs declare `'name' => $attributes->whereStartsWith('wire:model')->first()` and then
`$invalid ??= ($name && $errors->has($name))`. A Flux field therefore auto-renders — and turns red —
for an error whose bag key **exactly equals its own `wire:model` path**. 0029's
`CreateProductVariant` throws `derived_sku_taken` on the key **`sku`**, and 0027's `Editor` binds
`wire:model="sku"` to the *product's* SKU input. Under (B), a variant's cross-table SKU collision would
paint the product's SKU field red and print *"SKU 0001-M is already used by product X"* beside a field
the administrator never touched. Fixable only by re-keying every throw at the catch site, i.e. by
amending 0029's shipped action to accommodate a UI choice.

*Rejected:* (C), on 0027 **D-1**'s own logic run backwards — the editor is a page precisely so the whole
product is edited in one place, and splitting variants onto a second URL discards unsaved product edits
at the exact moment an administrator is most likely to have them. *Rejected:* (D), which would be this
codebase's first island for no gain on the deciding criterion.

**Embed shape** — the child needs nothing from `Editor`'s PHP, because `$productId` is already in Blade
scope:

```blade
{{-- resources/views/livewire/products/editor.blade.php — a section below the product form --}}
<flux:separator class="my-8" />

@if ($productId !== null)
    <livewire:products.variant-builder :product-id="$productId" wire:key="variant-builder-{{ $productId }}" />
@else
    <flux:callout icon="information-circle">
        {{ __('products.variants.builder.requires_saved_product') }}
    </flux:callout>
@endif
```

The child re-declares `#[Locked] public string $productId` and **re-reads the model with `findOrFail()`
at the top of every method** — the 0022 **D6** `$optionResolver` precedent applied verbatim, and the
`#[Locked]`-plus-server-authoritative-id discipline 0027 inherited as its obligation 3.

**Not a tab strip.** **FE-V3** verifies Flux Free 2.15.0 ships **no `tabs`**, no `combobox`, no
`accordion` and no repeater primitive. A "General | Variantes" tab strip would have to be hand-rolled or
faked with `flux:navbar`; a plain section under a `flux:separator` needs no new primitive and keeps the
page's single "Guardar producto" button unambiguous.

### D-2 — The combination is composed in a **keyed repeater of paired selects** *(the one place the two specialists split)*

```
┌ Combinación ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [ Color        ▾ ]  [ azul marino ▾ ]              [✕]  │
│  [ Talla        ▾ ]  [ L           ▾ ]              [✕]  │
│  ⊕ Añadir atributo                                       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The split, stated plainly.** `frontend-expert` proposed an **add-a-row repeater**
(`$combinationRows[$i] = ['key' => …, 'typeId' => '', 'valueId' => '']`); `frontend-qa` proposed a
**map keyed by attribute type** (`$selectedValues[$typeId] = $valueId`, pre-seeded to `''` for every
type). Both structurally prevent the **DIS-1** shape (`Size 40 / Size 41`), which matters because 0029's
DIS-1 was resolved as an *application-level rule only* on the explicit ground that *"the UI cannot
produce such a combination"* — so whichever shape ships, that claim must stay true.

**Recommendation: the repeater**, for two reasons the map cannot answer:

1. **It scales.** The map renders one select pair per attribute type **in the whole catalog**, always.
   At 10¹–10² types that is a form nobody can use, and it makes "this product uses Size and Color" an
   accident of which rows were left blank rather than a choice.
2. **It matches the established house pattern.** 0028 **D4** / 0030 already built a keyed value
   repeater for exactly this shape, including the two keying rules it needs.

**What is adopted from `frontend-qa`'s shape regardless**, because it is the better half of that
proposal: its selector insight (**QA-V5**) survives the change. `flux:select` derives its `name` from
the `wire:model` path, so a positional binding `wire:model.live="combinationRows.0.typeId"` yields
`name="combinationRows.0.typeId"` — a **contract-derived selector needing no new `data-test` hook**, and
the anchor [D-9](#d-9--the-null-select-desync-detector-and-why-every-obvious-test-for-it-provably-cannot-work)'s
detector uses.

**The two keying rules, both mandatory and both easy to get backwards** (0028 **D4**, 0030's traps 1–2):

```blade
@foreach ($combinationRows as $index => $row)
    <div wire:key="{{ $row['key'] }}">                        {{-- STABLE server-generated key --}}
        <flux:select wire:model.live="combinationRows.{{ $index }}.typeId" ...>   {{-- POSITIONAL path --}}
        <flux:select wire:model.live="combinationRows.{{ $index }}.valueId" ...>
        <flux:button wire:click="removeCombinationRow(@js($row['key']))" ... />   {{-- by KEY, never index --}}
    </div>
@endforeach
```

`key` is assigned once with `(string) Str::uuid()` and never mutated; removal is **by key, never by
index**. A positional `wire:key` makes Livewire's DOM diff reuse the wrong row's client state after a
removal, and an index-based removal deletes the wrong row after any reorder.

**One-value-per-type is enforced structurally**: once a type is chosen in a row it is removed from every
other row's type options, so `Size 40 / Size 41` is unbuildable — which is what keeps 0029 **DIS-1**'s
verdict honest.

**Ordering:** the type select lists types in `(position ASC, id ASC)` — **the same order the derivation
uses** — so the rows read in the same order as the SKU. Rows themselves stay in **insertion** order while
editing (a row must never jump under the cursor), while the SKU preview renders in **D-4.2** order. That
divergence is deliberate and is the cheapest way to teach the rule; see
[D-4](#d-4--the-live-sku-preview-is-a-server-side-computed-never-a-property-and-never-client-side)'s
provisional-label note for the wrinkle it creates.

*Rejected:* [0022](../done/0022-searchable-multi-select-component.md)'s searchable multi-select, on three
grounds. Its selection carries **bare ids with no structure**, so its `group` field could display the
type name but cannot *enforce* one option per group — reopening DIS-1 from the UI. Its **D11** excludes
an already-selected option from results, which is the wrong exclusion here (after picking Size 40 you
want the other **Size** values hidden, not just that one). And at 10¹–10² types × 10¹–10² values, search
adds nothing two selects do not already give. *Rejected:* a checkbox matrix of every type × value —
that **is** the axis picker for a generator, and without one it produces an ambiguous selection.

> pre-selects the generator's checkboxes.

**No "generate all combinations" bulk builder in this story.** Both specialists reached this
independently, and the reasoning is worth recording in full because the PRD's word *"generate"* invites
the opposite conclusion.

1. **The PRD does not ask for it (FE-V12).** §2.2's only creation scenario is singular — *"When they
   **generate the variant** 'Size 40 / Color Black'"* — and per
   [gherkin-guidelines.md](../../../docs/testing/frontend/gherkin-guidelines.md) rule 3 that single `When`
   is a one-variant verb. There is no bulk scenario anywhere in the PRD.
2. **The declaration table is *not* what is missing.** A generator is buildable on 0029's shipped
   surface with the axes held as transient UI state — pick Size 38/39/40 and Color Black/White, call
   `CreateProductVariant` six times. 0029's **OQ-5b** table would make the axis set *persistent*, which
   is a nicety, not a blocker.
3. 🔴 **What is genuinely missing is the outcome semantics, and that is a backend gap.** 0029 ships
   **no batch action**. Six calls means six transactions and six independent `lockForUpdate()`
   cross-table checks — so when combination 4 collides via **D-4.5** case (a)/(b)/(c), **1–3 are
   committed and 4–6 are not**. The administrator is left with a half-built catalog, a wall of per-row
   errors, and **no undo**, because variants are hard-deleted (0029 **D-6**, no `SoftDeletes`). Wrapping
   the six calls in this component's own `DB::transaction()` nests savepoints around six actions that
   each open their own transaction *and* holds every gap lock for the whole batch — precisely the
   exposure 0029 **R-M** warns about, now in a screen rather than in an action.
4. **`price` is `NOT NULL`** (0029 **OQ-2a**), so a generator must supply one per generated row and owns
   that decision too.

**What 0029 (or a new story) would have to add for a generator to be shippable**, stated precisely so
the PO can price it rather than discover it:

- `app/Actions/Products/GenerateProductVariants.php` — one transaction, all-or-nothing, refusing the
  whole batch on any collision with a message naming the offending combination; **or** an explicitly
  specified per-row outcome contract (`created` / `skipped_existing` / `refused` + reason) the UI can
  render as a result table.
- A **read-only** derivation/collision preview seam, so the generator can show which rows will succeed
  *before* writing anything (the same seam [OQ-5](#open-questions) wants for the single-variant form).

Raised as **[OQ-2](#open-questions)**. It is the largest scope question in this story and it changes the
story's own classification (see [Type](#type)).

**One mitigation available today at zero backend cost, and recommended:** default a new variant's type
rows from the **types this product's existing variants already use**, read at render time. It gives the
common case ("another size") one click, needs no declaration table, and is purely presentational.

### D-4 — The live SKU preview is a server-side `#[Computed]`, never a property, and never client-side

| | ✅ **Server-side `#[Computed]`** | Client-side JS | Only after save |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Correctness | exact — calls the **one** `VariantSku::derive()` definition | 🔴 **a second copy of the formula** | exact |
| Teaches D-4.2 | ✅ the administrator watches segment order follow the *type* order, not their click order | ✅ | ❌ |
| Cost | one round trip per value pick | zero | zero |

**Why client-side is rejected outright rather than weighed.** 0029's files table says of
`app/Support/VariantSku.php` that *"a second copy of the formula anywhere is the defect this class
exists to prevent"* (**R-L**). A JS copy cannot faithfully reproduce `Str::ascii()` transliteration, the
`[^A-Za-z0-9._/-]` strip, the whitespace-run collapse or the `MAX_LENGTH = 128` refusal — and, fatally,
**it gets `M`, `L` and `azul marino` exactly right**, so every naturally-written test passes while
`Marrón` previews as `0002-Marrón` and stores as `0002-Marron`. That asymmetry is why
[the browser test for it](#tests-to-perform) must use a value whose `segment()` is *not* the identity.

```php
// app/Livewire/Products/VariantBuilder.php
/**
 * The SKU the current combination would derive, or null while nothing is chosen.
 * A #[Computed] METHOD, never a property: a Livewire property is sent in the snapshot whether or
 * not its input is disabled, so a property here would re-open exactly the typed-claimant problem
 * the derivation removes. See story 0029 D-4.3 and its Definition of Done hand-off.
 */
#[Computed]
public function skuPreview(): ?string
{
    $values = $this->orderedSelectedValues();   // strings read back from the DB, in D-4.2 order

    return $values === [] ? null : VariantSku::derive($this->product()->sku, $values);
}
```

Five load-bearing details:

1. 🔴 **The value *strings* are read back out of the database**, in the same query that feeds the
   selects — never taken from the request payload. This is 0029's **V-10** applied to the preview:
   `Rule::exists()` is case-insensitive under `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`, so a payload naming a
   differently-cased id would preview one SKU and store another. The builder already loads
   `ProductAttributeType::with('values')` for the selects, so this costs **zero extra queries**.
2. **`wire:model.live` is mandatory** on the value select. `wire:model` is deferred by default in
   Livewire 4, and a deferred binding **syncs perfectly under `Livewire::test()->set()`** — so a missing
   `.live` produces a preview that never moves a character in a real browser while every component test
   stays green. See **FP-V4**.
3. **Nothing is ever posted back.** No `wire:model`, no hidden input, no `readonly` `<flux:input>`, and
   **no public property named `sku` on this component at all**.
4. **Partial combinations** render the derivation of the completed rows only, labelled **provisional**.
   The honest wrinkle the copy must carry: because **D-4.2** orders by *type position*, adding a second
   value can **insert a segment in the middle** (`0002-L` → `0002-azul-marino-L`), which reads like the
   SKU changed retroactively. That is exactly why it is labelled provisional rather than shown as a fait
   accompli. An empty combination renders a placeholder, **never a bare parent SKU** — see
   [OQ-4](#open-questions).
5. **Presentation is deliberately not an input:**

```blade
<flux:field>
    <flux:label>{{ __('products.variants.sku.preview_label') }}</flux:label>

    <div class="rounded-lg border border-zinc-200 bg-zinc-50 px-3 py-2 font-mono text-sm
                text-zinc-700 dark:border-white/10 dark:bg-white/5 dark:text-zinc-300"
         data-test="variant-sku-preview">
        {{ $this->skuPreview ?? '—' }}
    </div>

    <flux:description>{{ __('products.variants.sku.derived_notice') }}</flux:description>
</flux:field>
```

`<flux:input readonly>` was considered and rejected: it *looks* like a field, and it invites a future
reviewer to "wire it up" — which is the one change that reopens the whole typed-claimant problem.

### D-5 — Preview and stored SKU are **two different sources**, and conflating them is a silent data bug

For a **saved** variant the list renders the **stored `sku` column**. For the **unsaved** form it renders
the **preview**. They must never be confused, and after a successful create the list must re-read the
stored value rather than reuse the preview string.

🔴 **The concrete bug this prevents — `frontend-qa`'s finding, and it exists nowhere in 0029.** An
administrator opens the builder; someone renames an attribute value in another tab; they return and add
a variant. 0029's derivation reads the value strings **back out of the database** (**V-10**), so the
**stored** SKU is correct — while the preview they just read was built from the option list loaded at
mount. They see `0002-azul-marino`; the catalog gets `0002-azul`. Nothing errors, nothing looks wrong,
and the divergence is permanent.

Three requirements follow, all testable:

- **R1 — the variants list is a `#[Computed]` over a query, never a `mount()`-populated public array.**
  This converts "stale until a full page reload" into "stale until the next interaction", which is the
  best achievable without polling. It is also what makes the read-time image inheritance of
  [D-6](#d-6--inheritance-is-rendered-and-labelled-null-is-the-flag-and-it-stays-null) actually
  re-resolve.
- **R2 — after a successful create, the builder re-reads the created variant's SKU from the database**
  and renders that, never the previewed string.
- **R3 — `confirmDelete()` re-reads the target's label *and* SKU from the database** into `#[Locked]`
  properties. This is [livewire-authorization.md](../../../docs/security/livewire-authorization.md)'s own
  rule — *"a modal must read authoritative values from the model rather than back them out of a
  client-writable array"* — with a **stale-rename trigger** rather than a tampering one: naming the
  target from a client-held array lets an administrator confirm *"Delete `0002-azul-marino`"* and
  actually delete a variant now called `0002-azul`.

### D-6 — Inheritance is rendered **and labelled**; `NULL` is the flag and it stays `NULL`

0029 **D-7** resolves the image at read time and forbids copying the parent's `featured_media_id` into
the variant row. Every row therefore shows an image, which means **the image alone carries no
information** — the state must be labelled:

| State | Thumbnail | Marker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Own image | the variant's own media | `<flux:badge size="sm" color="lime">` — *Propia* |
| Inherited | the **parent's** featured media | `<flux:badge size="sm" color="zinc">` — *Heredada* |
| Neither (the parent has none either) | 0027 **OQ-2**'s placeholder tile — the *same* one, not a second design | none |

*Rejected:* reduced opacity or a bare link icon for the inherited case. Opacity reads as *disabled*, and
an unlabelled icon is not accessible. The badge is explicit, translatable and screen-reader-visible; the
tile also carries an `aria-label` naming the state.

**Clearing an own image** is a per-row action labelled `products.variants.image.revert_to_inherited` —
*"Usar la imagen del producto"*, **never** *"Eliminar imagen"*, which would tell the administrator the
variant ends up with no image. It sets `featuredMediaId = null` and calls `UpdateProductVariant`; no
confirmation, because it is non-destructive and instantly reversible.

**One `media.gallery` instance, mounted once — never one per row.** Livewire registers every `#[On]`
listener as a **page-global `window.addEventListener`**, and the event-name string is the only thing
separating instances (0020 **D2**/**V3**, 0027 **D-8**). One Gallery per variant row would share one
literal and **every row would receive every selection**. The single instance targets whichever variant
the open form addresses, tracked by `#[Locked] public ?string $editingVariantId`.

> 🔵 **This makes a *fourth* Gallery instance on the product editor page.** 0027 **D-8** tabulates three
> (`featured-image-selected`, `product-images-added`, and 0021's per-instance-derived
> `wysiwyg-image-selected-{componentId}`). `variant-image-selected` is a fourth distinct literal, which
> is safe — but 0027's table and the docs pass must gain the row, or the next reader will believe three
> is the complete set.

**R-D is incomplete as 0029 states it.** 0029 **R-D** says a variants list must eager-load
`['featuredImage', 'product.featuredImage']`. The combination column renders `ProductVariant::label()`,
which 0029 **D-9** specifies as an accessor over the eager-loaded pivot ordered by
`(type.position, value.position)` — so it also needs **`values`** and each value's **`type`**, neither of
which R-D mentions. Without them the combination column N+1s twice per row. The correct load:

```php
$this->product()->variants()                              // 0029 adds Product::variants(), position ASC, sku ASC
    ->with([
        'featuredImage:id,title,path,webp_path,avif_path', // 0019's REAL columns — 0027 D-17 / V-7
        'values.type:id,name,position',
    ])
    ->get();
```

`product.featuredImage` is deliberately **absent**: the builder already holds the parent, so the
parent's featured image is loaded once into component state and inheritance is resolved in PHP. The view
then never touches `$variant->product`, which is the actual N+1 in R-D's shape.

### D-7 — Variants are written **immediately and independently**, never inside `Editor::save()`

One `CreateProductVariant` / `UpdateProductVariant` / `DeleteProductVariant` call per gesture, committed
on the spot. Five structural reasons, not a preference:

1. `product_variants.product_id` is **NOT NULL** (0029 **D-6**), so a variant cannot be staged before its
   product row exists.
2. **The SKU derives from `products.sku` as persisted** (**D-4.1**). Deriving from an uncommitted in-form
   SKU produces a preview that is wrong the moment the product save is abandoned.
3. **D-4.5's collision check is a `lockForUpdate()` read across two tables in a fixed order.** Folding N
   variant creations into 0027 **D-12b**'s product+regions transaction would hold those gap locks across
   the whole gesture, widening exactly the deadlock window 0029 **R-M** exists to control.
4. **D-4.6's re-derivation cascade lives inside `UpdateProduct`.** A product SKU change and a variant
   creation in one transaction means deriving a variant SKU from a SKU that the same transaction is
   rewriting — undefined by construction.
5. 0029 ships **no batch action and no all-or-nothing wrapper** for variants (see **D-3**).

**Consequence for the create path, and one amendment 0027 should make.** On `products.create` the
builder is not rendered at all. That is correct, but 0027 **D-12c** redirects to `products.index` after a
successful save, so the natural "create a product, then add its variants" flow bounces the administrator
to the list. **Recommended: 0027's create path redirects to `products.edit` for the newly-created
product** (the edit path keeps redirecting to the list). One line in 0027's `save()`; raised as
**[OQ-7](#open-questions)**.

### D-8 — Where every refusal renders, and why none of them renders on its own

🔴 **This is the easiest thing on this screen to get silently wrong.** **FE-V4** is the mechanism: a Flux
field auto-renders an error whose bag key **exactly equals its `wire:model` path**. **None** of 0029's
throws matches a field path on this screen, so **every one of them must be rendered explicitly** — left
alone, three of four refusals are *invisible to the administrator* while every backend test is green.

> 🟣 **2026-08-19 — the keys below are no longer this story's recommendation; they are 0029's
> contract.** [0029 **D-15**](../done/0029-product-variants-backend.md#d-15--error-bag-keys-the-exact-key-every-refusal-throws-on)
> answers [OQ-3](#open-questions)(a) exactly as recommended and publishes the **complete six-key
> table**, adding three keys this section had not accounted for. Two of 0029's own rules are worth
> repeating here because they shape the markup:
>
> - **`combination` is deliberately *not* keyed to `attributeValueIds`**, and 0029 says so citing this
>   section: a duplicate combination is a fault of the **set**, not of any submitted id, and keeping
>   the key distinct is *"only expressible because"* D-8 puts it under the whole fieldset.
> - **All four SKU refusals share the single key `sku`** and are *"distinguished by their **translation
>   key**, never by their bag key"*. 0029 records this as its own **R-Q**/**FP17**: a test asserting
>   the exception class — or even the bag key — **cannot fail against the wrong message**. Every
>   assertion in this story therefore asserts the **rendered message**, never the key alone.

| Bag key | Message | Bound to a field here? | Renders |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `combination` | `products.variants.duplicate_combination` | **no** | a `flux:error` **inside the combination `flux:fieldset`**, under the last row — the errored thing is the row-set, not any one select |
| `sku` | `products.variants.derived_sku_taken` (interpolates `:sku`, names the conflicting record per 0029 **D-4.5** point 2) | **no** — there is no SKU input, by design | a `flux:callout variant="danger"` **immediately under the SKU preview** |
| `sku` | `products.variants.derived_sku_empty_segment` (names the offending value) | **no** | same callout |
| `sku` | `products.variants.derived_sku_too_long` | **no** | same callout |
| 🟣 `attributeValueIds` | 0029's array-level rules (absent, not an array, empty, over `max:10`, duplicate id, unknown id, **or an id that survives `Rule::exists()` and does not come back from the V-10 read-back**) | 🔴 **no** — the rows bind `combinationRows.{i}.valueId`, **not** `attributeValueIds` | **the same `flux:error` inside the combination fieldset** as `combination`. This key was missed by the original table and would have rendered nowhere at all |
| 🟣 `featuredMediaId` | `variantFeaturedMediaIdRules()`'s `Rule::exists('media', 'id')` | 🔴 **no** — the image is chosen through the Gallery event, so nothing binds a field of that name | a `flux:error` **beside the image picker**. Only reachable if the Gallery hands back an id that has since been deleted, which is exactly the race worth surfacing rather than swallowing |
| `combinationRows.{i}.typeId` / `.valueId`, `price`, `stock` | this component's own rules | ✅ yes | auto-rendered by Flux — these **are** bound paths |

🔴 **Every one of the six rows above renders nowhere unless this story renders them.** That was already
D-8's headline; 0029's amendment made it worse by two keys before making it explicit, and 0029's own
Definition of Done now repeats the obligation *"so the hand-off is recorded on both sides"*.

> 🔴 **Note appended 2026-09-06, and a correction along with it.** A seventh row, `attributeTypeIds`,
> briefly lived here while the generator shipped as part of this story (2026-08-19 to 2026-09-06) — the

> deliberately named after it. It moved to **[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)**'s own copy

> six**, not "five of seven" as the pre-split text read (a pre-existing off-by-one in that count, closed
> in the same pass rather than propagated: with only one auto-rendering row in the seven and that row now
> gone, all six remaining rows are unbound).

Three things to pin:

1. **A `derived_sku_taken` refusal must name a remedy.** 0029 **OQ-16a** ships **no override**, so the
   administrator cannot resolve the collision from this form at all. The message names the conflicting
   record; the builder appends the two real remedies — *"Cambia el SKU del producto o renombra el valor
   del atributo."* (`products.variants.sku.remedy_hint`).
2. **`closeForm()` must call `resetErrorBag()`.** 0025 **R-6**'s stale-error trap bites harder here,
   because the error is attached to a *derived* value the next combination no longer produces.
3. **R-F becomes UI-visible.** `product_variants` carries two unique indexes and 0029's `23000` catch
   must disambiguate them; if it mislabels, the builder faithfully renders "duplicate combination" in
   the wrong place. The builder cannot detect this — **the browser test must assert which message
   appears for each of D-4.5's three collision cases**, not merely that *a* message appeared.

**One cheap improvement worth taking.** Because the saved variants are already loaded with their value
ids, the builder can find the colliding row in PHP by comparing sorted value-id sets — no hash, no extra
query — and **highlight it in the table with a "ver" anchor** (`products.variants.combination.duplicate_of`).

### D-9 — The null-`<select>` desync detector, and why every obvious test for it **provably cannot work**

[errors-log.md](../../../docs/errors-log.md)'s 2026-08-16 entry is the single most relevant prior incident
to this screen, and this screen is **the worst case in the codebase so far**: two native `<select>`s per
combination row, bound to *array paths*, where the natural default for an unset element is `null` — the
forbidden value, reached by a route (an unset array key) the original `roleId` fix does not cover.
**FE-V4** confirms `flux:select`'s only variant renders a genuine native `<select>`.

> 🔴 **`frontend-qa` verified that all three obvious tests for this are structurally incapable of
> failing against the bug — and that a claim in a *shipped* test in this repository is therefore
> false.** `product-owner` independently re-verified each.

| Approach | Why it cannot fail against the bug |
| --- | --- |
| `Livewire::test()->set(…)` | Writes the property; no DOM exists. (The errors-log already says so.) |
| `visit(…)->select(…)` | **QA-V1** — `InteractsWithElements::select()` is a one-line pass-through to Playwright's `selectOption`, whose injected implementation does `select.value = void 0`, sets `option.selected = true`, then dispatches `input` **and** `change` **unconditionally**. It destroys the pre-existing `selectedIndex` before anything can observe it, and it manufactures the very event whose *absence* is the bug. |
| `assertValue()` / `assertSelected()` | **QA-V3** — both resolve to Playwright's `inputValue()` → `select.value`, which returns `''` **both** when the disabled placeholder is correctly selected **and** when `selectedIndex === -1`. Indistinguishable. |

**The detector that does work — `assertScript()` on `selectedIndex` (QA-V4), read before any
interaction:**

```php
->assertScript(
    "document.querySelector('[name=\"combinationRows.0.typeId\"]').selectedIndex",
    0                       // 0 = the disabled placeholder is genuinely selected
)                           //-1 = wire:model assigned "null"/"undefined" — the bug
```

`selectedIndex` is the **only** DOM property that separates the two states. This is a *root-cause*
assertion: it fails the instant a bound value is `null`, before any user action, with no event-timing
dependency and no flakiness.

**Three structural requirements that make the whole class impossible**, which is cheaper than detecting
it:

- **Every bound value is `''`, never `null` and never absent.** A row is created as
  `['key' => …, 'typeId' => '', 'valueId' => '']`. *An unset array element dehydrates to `undefined` in
  the browser, which stringifies just as fatally as `null`* — this is the array-shaped version of the
  original bug, and it is why a row must be fully seeded on creation rather than lazily filled.
- **Both placeholders are `<option value="" disabled selected>`**, per 0027 **D-5**'s new markup rule.
- 🔴 **The dependent-select reset.** Changing a row's type changes the value select's option set. If the
  old `valueId` survives, the DOM holds a value no option carries — **the same desync arrived at from
  the other direction**, and it is invisible to `Livewire::test()->set()`. `wire:model.live` on the type
  select plus an `updated('combinationRows.*.typeId')` hook resetting that row's `valueId` to `''` in
  the same round trip.

> 🔵 **Finding to hand to `docs-keeper`, not to fix here.** `tests/Browser/UsersIndexTest.php` carries a
> comment asserting that picking the first option *"is the only choice that actually exercises the
> fix"*. **QA-V1** shows it is not: `->select()` fires `change` regardless, so that test passes
> identically against `public ?string $roleId = null`. It remains a good round-trip test; it is **not**
> the regression net the errors-log entry believes exists. Recorded in
> [Risks](#dependencies-findings-and-risks) as **R-3** and in the Definition of Done as a docs hand-off.

### D-10 — Authorization gates against the **parent product**, once, with no per-row matrix

0029 **D-12** ships `ProductVariant` with **no policy of its own**: every variant operation authorizes
against the parent product through `ProductPolicy`.

> 🔴 **Corrected 2026-09-04 (0029's own Phase 2 amendment), quoted in full rather than silently
> rewritten, per this project's audit-authored-page convention.** This paragraph used to end here: *"The
> actions **do not self-authorize**, so this story is 0029's only enforcement path."* That is no longer
> true and was corrected the same day this file's own top-of-file amendment note (2026-09-04, point 2)
> records: 0029's **D-12.1** makes all four variant actions (`CreateProductVariant`,
> `UpdateProductVariant`, `DeleteProductVariant`, `GenerateProductVariantCombinations`) **self-authorize**
> against the parent product, via `LogRefusedPrivilegedAttempt`, as their own first statement. **This
> story's gates below are defence in depth, not the only layer** — still mandatory in every method that
> mutates or discloses, still what fails fast before a transaction opens client-side and what keeps the
> per-row disabled-state UI hint honest (note 4 below), but a caller reaching any of the four actions
> directly (an Artisan command, a queued job, a future second component) is no longer ungated. Nothing
> else in this section needed a rewrite: the six `Gate::authorize()` call sites below are correct exactly
> as specified, now as the second layer rather than the only one.

```php
public function mount(string $productId): void { $this->productId = $productId; Gate::authorize('view', $this->product()); }
public function openCreateForm(): void         { Gate::authorize('update', $this->product()); … }
public function openEditForm(string $id): void { Gate::authorize('update', $this->product()); … }   // DISCLOSES price/stock
public function saveVariant(…): void           { Gate::authorize('update', $this->product()); … }
public function confirmDelete(string $id): void{ Gate::authorize('update', $this->product()); … }
public function deleteVariant(…): void         { Gate::authorize('update', $this->product()); … }
#[On('variant-image-selected')]
public function setVariantImage(array $media): void { Gate::authorize('update', $this->product()); … }
```

Five notes:

1. **`update` for create, too.** Per 0029 **OQ-12**, all three variant operations map to `products.edit`
   — adding or removing a variant is a *modification of an existing catalog record*, not bringing a
   product into or out of the catalog. The resulting line looks wrong at a glance
   (`Gate::authorize('update', …)` inside a *create* method) and needs its comment. Confirm as
   **[OQ-1](#open-questions)** before Phase 3: if it flips, six lines and the whole authorization
   fixture change.
2. **`openEditForm()` gates because it *discloses*** a variant's price and stock —
   [livewire-authorization.md](../../../docs/security/livewire-authorization.md)'s rule is "mutates **or**
   discloses".
3. **`mount()` gates even though the page route already does.** `Livewire::test()` reaches `mount()`
   with no route, and the child is a second `/livewire/update` entry point. Whether route
   `PersistentMiddleware` propagates to a *child* component's own update request is **unverified**; it
   does not matter, because the child gates itself — but Phase 3 must not assume it either way.
4. **No per-row authorization matrix.** Every `ProductPolicy` ability answers identically for every
   variant of one product (they all target the same parent), so per-row `Gate::allows()` would be N
   identical calls. Compute **once** into `#[Locked] public bool $canManageVariants` from
   `Gate::allows('update', $this->product())` — the *same* policy method the mutating paths authorize
   against, satisfying
   [authorization.md](../../../docs/architecture/authorization.md#gateallows-in-a-list-query-is-a-ui-hint-not-a-layer)'s
   cannot-drift rule — and render every disabled branch from it. This is 0027 **R-9**'s "do not model
   this too literally on Users" applied concretely.
5. **No `->ignore()` anywhere on the variant side.** 0029 **D-4.7** removed it: the SKU is derived, so
   there is nothing to validate and no id to feed `Rule::unique()->ignore()`. **State this in the
   component docblock**, so a reviewer looking for the `#[Locked]`/`->ignore()` pair (0027's inherited
   obligation 3) knows its absence is correct rather than missing.

**Route:** none added. The builder inherits `products.edit`'s `can:products.view` — **never**
`permission:products.view`, since Livewire 4's `PersistentMiddleware` allow-list carries Laravel's
`Authorize` but not Spatie's `PermissionMiddleware` ([api/routes.md](../../../docs/api/users-and-roles.md#usersindex--the-first-permission-gated-route)).

### D-11 — Editing a variant: the combination is shown **fixed**, not disabled

0029 **D-13** makes a combination immutable after creation. The edit form therefore renders it as
**static badges**, not as disabled selects:

```blade
@if ($editingVariantId !== null)
    <div class="flex flex-wrap items-center gap-2">
        @foreach ($lockedCombination as $pair)
            <flux:badge color="zinc">{{ $pair['type'] }}: {{ $pair['value'] }}</flux:badge>
        @endforeach
    </div>
    <flux:description>{{ __('products.variants.combination.immutable_notice') }}</flux:description>
@else
    {{-- the editable repeater --}}
@endif
```

Disabled selects were rejected for two reasons: Flux's own `disabled:pointer-events-none` makes them
un-hoverable, so an explanation cannot be attached to them (errors-log, 2026-08-16), and a disabled
control reads as *temporarily* unavailable — the opposite of "immutable by design".

Only `price`, `stock` and `featured_media_id` are editable, matching exactly what
`UpdateProductVariant` may write.

**"I want to change this variant's combination"** → an explanatory note plus the existing Delete action.
No compound "replace" affordance in v1. If one is ever wanted (**[OQ-8](#open-questions)**), the ordering
is non-obvious and is recorded now: it must be **create-then-delete**, never delete-then-create, because
a delete-first flow that fails on the create **loses the variant permanently** (hard delete, no restore).
Create-first is safe *precisely because* **D-3**'s uniqueness is scoped to
`(product_id, combination_hash)` — the replacement's combination is by definition different, so it
cannot collide with the original's hash or SKU.

**Deleting** is a `flux:modal` confirmation naming **both** the derived `label()` *and* the stored `sku`
(the SKU is the operational identifier an administrator recognises), mirroring `Users\Index` and 0027
**D-3**: `#[Locked]` properties re-read with `findOrFail()` (**D-5** R3), inner content wrapped in
`@if ($showDeleteModal)` so only one Cancel control is ever in the DOM, and the error bag cleared on
close.

⚠️ **The copy must say the removal is permanent.** Every previous delete confirmation in this app
(Users, 0005) is a **soft** delete; this one is not. Reusing that wording would misinform. New key
`products.variants.delete.irreversible`.

### D-12 — The create/edit **form** is an inline panel; only the delete confirmation is a modal

**FE-V5** verifies `flux:modal` renders a native `<dialog>` inside `<ui-modal>`. Putting the variant form
in a modal means opening 0020's Gallery — itself a `<dialog>` — **from inside another `<dialog>`**: two
stacked focus traps, two body scroll locks, and the stacking-context class of problem that **0027 D-1
reason 1 refused to bet on when deciding the whole editor should be a page**. Native `<dialog>` nesting
is not categorically broken, but it is unverified in this stack and 0027 already ruled on the same
question one level up.

So: the form is an inline expanding `flux:card` under the variants table, the Gallery opens over the
page exactly as it does on the product form, and `flux:modal` is reserved for the delete confirmation
(which contains no nested modal).

### D-13 — Price and stock: strings, pre-filled, and identical in shape to 0027's

```php
/**
 * decimal:2 returns a STRING (0024 R-4 / 0029 R-C). Never float — a float reformats '19.90' to
 * 19.9 on every round trip — and never null, which is the errors-log desync trap.
 */
public string $price = '';

/** String for the same reason: an int property cannot hold the '' a cleared input sends. */
public string $stock = '0';
```

- **Pre-fill from the parent**, which is 0029 **OQ-2a**'s own answer to the ergonomic cost of a NOT NULL
  price: in the **create** branch only, `$this->price = $product->price;`. Because `price` is already the
  `decimal:2` **string** `'119.95'`, it round-trips byte-for-byte — **do not `number_format()` it**,
  which is the double-formatting bug **R-4** exists to warn about. The edit branch loads the variant's
  own price and never re-applies the parent's. A `flux:description` says the value was pre-filled, so it
  does not read as a locked mirror.
- **`type="text" inputmode="decimal"`, not `type="number"`** — the latter invites `19.999` (which 0024
  rejects) and, on a Spanish keyboard, produces `19,99` (which `decimal:0,2` refuses). The server rule
  stays the single authority. **Whatever 0027 does for the product price field, this screen does
  identically** — two visually different money inputs on one page is a defect in itself
  (**[OQ-9](#open-questions)**).
- **Stock** is `inputmode="numeric"`, rule `['required','integer','min:0']`. The column is deliberately
  **signed** (0029 **D-6**) so a negative never reaches MySQL as a `1264` 500; the UI's job is only to
  refuse it with a message.
- **Compose `ProductVariantValidationRules` alone.** Do **not** also compose 0024's
  `ProductValidationRules`: it would put `skuRules()` in reach of a component that must never validate a
  SKU, and 0029 entity-prefixed `variantPriceRules()` / `variantStockRules()` /
  `variantCombinationRules()` precisely so the two never need to meet.

```php
// injected per method, per code-style.md's per-method action-injection convention
CreateProductVariant::__invoke(
    Product $product, array $productAttributeValueIds, string $price, int $stock,
    ?string $featuredMediaId = null,
): ProductVariant;

UpdateProductVariant::__invoke(
    ProductVariant $variant, string $price, int $stock,
    ?string $featuredMediaId, ?int $position = null,
): ProductVariant;

DeleteProductVariant::__invoke(ProductVariant $variant): bool;
```

Four binding details, each of which changes a line this story had already written:

1. **The create action's array parameter is `$productAttributeValueIds`** — the *model-qualified* name,
   not `$attributeValueIds`. The **error-bag key is still `attributeValueIds`** (**D-15**'s camelCase-
   of-the-input rule); the parameter and the key differ on purpose and both are fixed. Do not
   "harmonise" them.
2. **`string $price`, never `float`** — **R-8** / 0024 **R-4**, and now enforced by the signature
   itself. `$this->price` is already the `decimal:2` string and is passed straight through.
3. **Both write actions return `ProductVariant`**, explicitly *"so the caller can render it without
   re-querying"*. This does **not** license bypassing **D-5 R2**: the returned model's `sku` is read
   from the row the action just wrote, which is the database value, so rendering it is correct —
   rendering the **preview string** is not. The distinction is the returned model versus
   `$this->skuPreview`, and only the second is forbidden.
4. 🔴 **`UpdateProductVariant`'s `?string $featuredMediaId` carries NO default** — corrected 2026-09-06
   (a `code-reviewer` finding on this file's earlier draft, verified against the real shipped file at
   `app/Actions/Products/UpdateProductVariant.php:57`). It is **not** the same-looking
   `?string $featuredMediaId = null` `CreateProductVariant` carries. [errors-log.md](../../../docs/errors-log.md#an-actions-own-parameter-default-reintroduced-the-omission-ambiguity-its-stricter-collaborator-was-built-to-close--2026-09-01)'s
   own rule is why: on **create**, omitting the image and "no image yet" denote the same real state, so
   a default is safe; on **update**, omission does not mean "clear the image" — it usually means the
   caller never touched that field — so a default would silently null out a variant's own image on every
   partial-field save. **Every call site in `openEditForm()`'s save path must therefore pass the
   variant's current `featured_media_id` explicitly** to leave it alone, `null` to clear it, or a new id
   to change it — never omit the argument. `?int $position = null` **does** carry a default and means
   "leave it alone"; see [D-16a](#d-16a--oq-6-resolved-variant-row-order-and-images-need-no-reorder-control-in-v1)
   for why no call site here ever passes it.

**None of the three authorizes** — 0029 **D-12** unchanged (now self-authorizing per **D-10**'s own
2026-09-04 correction, defence in depth against this story's own gates).

### D-14 — Every Flux/Blaze/Livewire trap this screen hits

All verified live in this repo, not recalled. **FE-V14**: `flux/select` and `flux/modal` both open with
`@blaze(fold: true, …)`, so Blaze compile-time folding is **live on the exact components this screen is
built from** — the errors-log's `tooltip` finding is not a historical curiosity here.

| # | Trap | Where it bites | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **T1** 🔴 | A `null` `wire:model`-bound property desyncs a native `<select>` | two selects **per row** — more than any prior screen | **D-9**: `''` everywhere, placeholders `disabled`, `selectedIndex` detector |
| **T2** 🔴 | **New instance of T1** — the dependent value select after a type change | the type→value pair | **D-9**'s reset hook, proven by real clicks asserting the **persisted** value |
| **T3** 🔴 | A `tooltip` prop **cannot** be conditionally bound (Blaze presence trap) | disabled edit/delete when `!$canManageVariants`; disabled "Añadir atributo" when every type is used | written-out `@if`/`@else` with `<flux:tooltip>` wrapping only the disabled branch — copy `users.blade.php` verbatim (**FE-V10**) |
| **T4** | `disabled:cursor-*` never renders — `disabled:pointer-events-none` removes the button from hit-testing | the same buttons | `cursor-not-allowed!` on the **`flux:tooltip` wrapper**; `cursor-pointer!` on enabled buttons |
| **T5** 🔴 | `@js()` on **every** id in a `wire:*` argument, UUIDs included | `openEditForm`, `confirmDelete`, `removeCombinationRow`, `revertToInheritedImage` | never `{{ }}` |
| **T6** 🔴 | Repeater keying — two axes, both required | the combination repeater | **D-2**: stable `wire:key`, positional `wire:model`, removal **by key** |
| **T7** 🔴 | A Flux field auto-binds an error only on an **exact** `wire:model` path match | all four of 0029's throws match nothing | **D-8**: render every one explicitly, and test that each is *visible* |
| **T8** | `wire:model` is **deferred** by default in Livewire 4 | the live preview would never move | `.live` on both selects |
| **T9** | Livewire listeners are page-global; `dispatchTo()` broadcasts by component **name** | a **fourth** Gallery instance joins the page's three | one instance, literal `variant-image-selected`, distinct `wire:key` — never one per row |
| **T10** 🔴 | Nested native `<dialog>` | a modal form opening the Gallery modal | **D-12**: inline panel |
| **T11** | Modal inner content must be wrapped in `@if ($showDeleteModal)` | the delete modal | one Cancel control in the DOM, ever |
| **T12** | `decimal:2` returns a **string** | `$price`, the price column, every assertion | **D-13**; `toBe('19.99')` with quotes |
| **T13** | The `@can('viewAny', Media::class)` wrapper (0020 **D12**) | the Gallery embed | without it, an actor who may edit products but lacks `media.view` gets the **whole page** 403'd by the child's own `Gate::authorize()`. Wrap the embed; render the trigger `disabled` inside an explicit `<flux:tooltip>` on the other branch |
| **T14** | **FE-V3**: no `flux:tabs`, no `flux:combobox`, no repeater primitive in Flux Free | anyone reaching for a tabbed editor or a searchable value picker | section-below-separator; hand-rolled repeater, as 0030 already established |
| **T15** | Icon-only actions need an `aria-label` **and** a `data-test` hook on **both** branches | every row action | `data-test="edit-variant-{id}"` / `"delete-variant-{id}"` / `"revert-variant-image-{id}"` |

### D-15 — Translation keys

`lang/en/products.php` and `lang/es/products.php` are **extended, never recreated**, key-for-key
identical. **FE-V8**: the file does not exist yet, and **this story is its seventh writer** (0024
creates; 0025, 0026, 0027, 0028, 0029 extend) — 0027's **R-7** at more than double the scale, and a key
missing from `lang/es` renders as its own raw key with no error.

**Already owned by 0029 — do not duplicate:** `products.variants.duplicate_combination`,
`.derived_sku_taken`, `.derived_sku_empty_segment`, `.derived_sku_too_long`,
`.parent_sku_change_collides`, `.value_in_use`, `.type_in_use`, and (for 0029b's generator, rendered by
**[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)**, not here) `products.variants.generate.empty_type`
(naming the type), `products.variants.generate.too_many` (interpolating `:limit` and `:attempted`) and
`products.variants.generate.summary` — a `trans_choice` over the created count interpolating `:skipped`
and `:refused`. These live in 0029's key space *"because the **action** owns the outcome vocabulary"*,
regardless of which story's panel renders them.

**New here** (nested sub-groups so nothing collides with 0029's flat leaves; every segment `snake_case`
per [naming.md](../../../docs/conventions/naming.md#translation-keys)):

### D-16 — The attribute-value rename edge case, resolved

> **This is the question `product-owner` was asked to resolve rather than defer, and it is resolved
> here.** 0029's **D-4.6** re-derives the SKU of every variant built on a renamed attribute value, in
> the same transaction — but that decision is still carried as 0029's open **OQ-13** (re-derive vs
> freeze vs a middle option). What follows is the **UI's** answer, and it contributes an argument 0029
> does not make.

**(a) Does the builder display a stale SKU until reload?** Briefly, and acceptably — *iff* **D-5**'s
**R1** holds. The rename happens on a different route (0030's screen), in another tab or by another
administrator; there is no polling and no broadcast. With the variant rows as a `#[Computed]` over a
query, the stale display self-heals on the **next Livewire round-trip** — any interaction at all. With a
`mount()`-time public array it stays stale until a full page load. R1 is what turns an unbounded
staleness into the same bounded staleness every list screen in this app already has, and it is testable:
mutate the value's string directly in the database between two renders of the same component instance
and assert the second render shows the new SKU.

**(b) Does anything need to warn *before* the rename? Yes — and it belongs to 0030, not here.** 0029
already builds `ProductAttributeValue::variants()` and the per-value in-use count for the *delete* guard
(**D-10**); the identical query answers *"renaming this value will rewrite N variant SKUs"*.
**Recommended: a non-blocking inline notice in 0030's value repeater** when an in-use value's text is
edited, with the total repeated at the save affordance. Non-blocking because the rename is legitimate
and D-4.6 makes it transactional and all-or-nothing. *Rejected:* no warning at all — an administrator
fixing a typo (`azul marnio` → `azul marino`) would silently rewrite SKUs printed on physical stock, and
0029's own OQ-13b argues that cost is real. Under 13a the rename **is** a catalog-wide mutation, and a
screen presenting it as a text edit is misleading.

> 🔴 **A second 0030 gap found here, and it is the sharper one.** D-4.6 aborts the whole rename on any
> resulting SKU collision — which means `products.variants.derived_sku_taken` can surface **on a
> taxonomy screen that has no SKUs on it**. 0030's contract has no error key, no field and no copy for
> that. Left as-is, an administrator renaming a value meets a message about a SKU with nothing to attach
> it to and no remedy on that screen. It must render against the offending value row (0030's own
> per-row error rule) and name the conflicting record. **[OQ-10](#open-questions)**.

**(c) Does an open editor page holding stale rows need handling? Yes, in exactly one place.** Read
staleness is (a). **Write** staleness is the dangerous half — and a rename changes the SKU *string* but
not the variant's `id`, so an inline price/stock save still targets the right row and is harmless. The
exception is the **delete confirmation**, which is why **D-5 R3** is a requirement rather than a
nicety.

The **same-page** case is sharper than the cross-page one: 0027's editor holds the product's `sku` field
*and* this builder. After a save that changes the SKU, D-4.6 rewrites every variant's SKU while the
rendered rows still say `0001-M`. 0027 **D-12c**'s redirect means the stale rows are never shown — but
that protection is **accidental**, so it must be asserted, not assumed.

**(d) Can displayed and stored SKU diverge unnoticed? Yes, in three distinct ways — two of them
invisible to every backend test.** Cross-page staleness (closed by R1); a preview re-implemented in JS
(closed by **D-4**); and the **stale-option-list divergence** described in **D-5** (closed by R2). Each
has a named test.

**The recommendation on 0029's OQ-13, from the UI's point of view: 13a (re-derive), with D-5's R1–R3 as
conditions.** The backend argument is that the formula stays globally assertable. The **UI-specific**
argument is stronger, and it settles the middle option outright:

- Under **13a**, the invariant *"what is displayed = `derive(current inputs)`"* holds on every screen, so
  the preview and the list are the same function of the same data and one test pins both.
- Under **13b (freeze)**, the builder must display SKUs the live preview can no longer reproduce. Add a
  variant to a product whose values were renamed last month and the new row follows a different formula
  from its neighbours'. Neither the UI nor a test can distinguish a correctly-frozen SKU from a bug — the
  screen would ship with a permanently unverifiable column.
- 🔴 **The middle option (freeze on value rename, re-derive on parent-SKU change) is not the cheap
  compromise it appears to be — it is unimplementable as specified.** The preview would have to know
  *which of a variant's inputs had ever been renamed* in order to render honestly, and nothing records
  that: there is no `sku_frozen_at`, no rename log. **It requires a new column**, so choosing it is a
  schema change and must land before Phase 3.

**What remains genuinely for the PO:** whether 0030's rename warning is blocking or non-blocking
(**OQ-10**), and whether the operational re-labelling cost is real enough to reopen 13b. **If 13b is
chosen, this story's entire preview design changes** — the preview would only be truthful for *new*
variants, and the list would need a visible marker distinguishing derived-current from frozen SKUs.

### D-16a — OQ-6 resolved: variant row order (and images) need no reorder control in v1

> 🔴 **Relocated and trimmed here 2026-09-06 from the old D-17.5, "Half 2".** The old **D-17.5** resolved
> [OQ-6](#open-questions) in two halves and lived under the generator UI's own heading only because it
> was written the same day the generator entered this story — neither half is actually
> generator-specific. Both halves survive here, trimmed of the generator's own worked example; 0031a's
> own (much shorter) D-17.5 references this section rather than re-arguing it.

[OQ-6](#open-questions) asked whether `position` ships on variants and noted *"it is not expressible
today"* — a reorder needs a whole-set rewrite in one transaction, and 0029 ships no
`ReorderProductVariants`. **R-6** filed it as the same shape as
[0027](../done/0027-products-list-and-editor-ui.md)'s **OQ-6**/**D-9a** finding about `SyncProductGallery` one
story over.

**Half 1 — variant *images*: the question does not apply, and it never could.** Checked against 0029's
schema rather than assumed: **a variant has exactly one optional own image**, `featured_media_id`, a
single nullable FK on `product_variants` ([0029 **D-5**](../done/0029-product-variants-backend.md#d-5--exact-schema)).
There is **no variant gallery pivot** — 0029 **D-9** rejects one outright (*"PRD says 'an optional
image', singular"*), and its scope fences repeat it as *"no `product_variant_media` gallery"*. So the
0024/`SyncProductGallery` ordered-array/index-position pattern has **nothing to apply to** on this
screen: there is no second image, therefore no order, therefore no reorder. This is not a deferral —
**the 0027-class bug is structurally absent from the variant image field**, and this story's existing
scope fence *"No variant gallery"* is what keeps it absent. The single image is chosen and reverted
through **D-6**'s one Gallery instance, and that is the whole of it. **This half holds with or without
0031a's generator ever shipping.**

**Half 2 — variant *row order*: `position` ships, is written by the backend in a useful order, and gets
no manual reorder control in v1.** The column is not dead schema, and this is true from
`CreateProductVariant` alone, no generator required: every single-variant create writes
`MAX(position) + 1` scoped to the product (0029 **D-8**), so a product built one variant at a time
already reads in creation order out of the box. **If 0031a's generator ships too, it becomes a second
writer** of the same column, in its own useful cartesian order (0029b's **D-G6**) — but the decision
below does not depend on that second writer existing:

| OQ-6's option | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| (a) 0029 adds `ReorderProductVariants` + this story ships move-earlier/move-later buttons | **Not taken.** 0029 declined it explicitly (0029b's **D-G7** — *"the cartesian order **D-G6** assigns is deliberately the useful one, which is what makes the absence tolerable"*), and **D-13a** point 4 records the same for the `?int $position` parameter that no call site here passes |
| (b) Do not ship the column | **Not taken, and no longer the tidy answer it was.** The column has a real writer the moment a single variant is created — `MAX(position) + 1` — with or without a generator |
| ✅ (c) Ship the column, ship no control | **Taken** — and it is no longer *"the worst of both"*, which is what this story called it while the column had no writer. Creation order alone already reads correctly for the single-variant path; a generator, if 0031a ships one, only makes a freshly-built batch *also* land in a useful order. The order the administrator wants is the order they get, without a control |

**What this closes, and the exact condition that reopens it.** OQ-6 is **resolved** and this story ships
**no reorder affordance of any kind** — no buttons, no drag (Flux Free ships nothing draggable anyway,
**FE-V3**), no `position` input. It reopens the moment an administrator wants an order the derivation
does not produce — a merchandising order like "M, L, S" against a Talla whose own `position` says
otherwise — and the fix is **not** this story's to invent:

> 🔵 **Follow-up amendment 0029 would need, described rather than designed here.** A manual reorder
> requires **`ReorderProductVariants(Product $product, array $orderedIds): void`** — a whole-sibling-set
> rewrite in **one** transaction, never pairwise swaps (0029 **D-8**, inheriting 0024 **D-8**), refusing
> an id set that is not exactly the product's current variant ids. 0029 already names the action and
> already explains why it is absent, so this is a **known, costed gap, not an oversight**. Per
> [contracts.md](../../../docs/contracts.md)'s rule against inventing a dependency's contract, this story
> does **not** specify it further and does **not** call `UpdateProductVariant`'s `$position` parameter
> N times to fake it — that is the pairwise-swap corruption the rule exists to prevent. If the PO wants
> manual ordering, it is an amendment to **0029** first and a small addition here second.

### D-17 — Pagination, kept from the old D-17.4 because it is not generator-specific

> 🔴 **Relocated and trimmed here 2026-09-06 from the old D-17.4, which sat under the generator UI's own
> heading.** Retrofitting pagination onto an already-shipped, already-tested component is the expensive

> (*"a freshly generated batch lands where expected"*) **was** generator-specific and moved to
> [0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md#d-174--the-pagination-consequence); the three points kept
> below are this story's own.

**Decision: the variants list paginates from the start**, `->paginate(25)` matching
[0027](../done/0027-products-list-and-editor-ui.md) **D-4**'s page size exactly (two differently-paginated lists
on one product screen is the same class of defect as **OQ-9**'s two money inputs). Three consequences,
all of which Phase 3 must carry:

1. **The order is already total and already declared**, so pagination is safe here in a way 0027 **D-4**
   had to argue for: `Product::variants()` orders `position ASC, sku ASC` **inside the relation** (0029
   **D-17.2**) and `sku` is `UNIQUE NOT NULL`, so no two pages can reshuffle a tie.
2. **`#[Computed]` still holds** (**D-5 R1**) — it returns a paginator rather than a collection, and it
   still re-reads per round trip, which is what keeps the stale-rename self-heal and the read-time image
   inheritance working.
3. **The "assert the exact sequence" tests scope to page 1** and gain one page-2 case, rather than being
   rewritten. **FP-V12** stands unchanged.

Page size is the only part left open — raised as **[OQ-13](#open-questions)**, recommending 25 for
consistency with 0027.

<!-- The old D-17, D-17.1–D-17.3 and D-17.5's generator-specific tail (the axis picker, the confirmed
generator action signature, the result summary panel, and the "position lands where the generator put
it" consequence) moved wholesale to 0031a in the 2026-09-06 Phase 2 INVEST split. See the amendment near
the top of this file and D-3's own restored history. -->

## Scope fences: what this story must NOT do

- **No migration, model, action, policy, enum, factory, seeder, validation rule or permission-catalog
  change.** Every one is consumed as shipped (0029 **D-12**: no new permission string, no
  `RolePermissionSeeder` edit).
- **No SKU input of any kind** — no field, no `readonly` input, no hidden field, no disabled input that
  still posts, and **no public property named `sku`** on the component (0029 **D-4.3** and its DoD).
- **No client-side re-implementation of the derivation formula** (**D-4**).
- **No cartesian "generate all combinations" UI** — **0031a's own story.** Fenced out here again as of
  the 2026-09-06 Phase 2 INVEST split (D-3, restored): a brief 2026-08-19 reversal put the generator's UI
  in this story against 0029b's `GenerateProductVariantCombinations`, but Phase 2 failed the bundled
  story on INVEST "Small" and the generator UI moved wholesale to
  **[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)**, sequenced immediately after this one. Nothing about
  the generator **existing** is reversed — see 0031a for its own scope fences (no dry-run/preview seam,
  no all-or-nothing batch semantics, no "regenerate and overwrite" affordance, no delete-missing sync
  mode, no `product_product_attribute_type` declaration table) — this story simply does not build it.
- **No editing of an existing variant's combination** (0029 **D-13**), and no "replace" affordance in v1.
- **No variant gallery** — PRD says *"an optional image"*, singular (0029 **D-9**), and 0029's own
  fences say *"no `product_variant_media` gallery"*. This is what makes
  [D-16a](#d-16a--oq-6-resolved-variant-row-order-and-images-need-no-reorder-control-in-v1)'s image
  half a non-question rather than a deferral.
- **No variant `status`** (0029 **D-9**/its **OQ-6**: `stock = 0` already expresses it).
- **No reorder control of any kind** — **[OQ-6](#open-questions)** is **resolved** to option (c)
  (**D-16a**): the column ships and is written by the backend in a useful order, and no UI writes it.
  In particular, **do not** call `UpdateProductVariant`'s `?int $position` parameter N times to
  simulate a reorder; that is the pairwise-swap corruption 0029 **D-8** forbids. A manual reorder
  begins with a `ReorderProductVariants` amendment on **0029**.
- **No new route, no sidebar entry, no `docs/api/routes.md` row** — the builder is a nested child of an
  existing routed page.
- **No changes to 0030's attribute-type screen** — the two gaps **D-16** found there are raised as
  amendment questions on **0030**, not performed here.
- **No re-running of a dependency's own suite**: not 0029's derivation/hash/collision/FK/in-use tests,
  not 0027's editor suite, not 0020's gallery mechanics, not 0030's repeater tests
  ([what-not-to-test.md](../../../docs/testing/qa/what-not-to-test.md)).
- No bulk actions, no CSV import, no duplicate-variant action, no i18n scaffolding (Epic 5).

## Files to create/modify

### Creates

| Path | What & why |
| --- | --- |
| `app/Livewire/Products/VariantBuilder.php` | The child component (**D-1**). Class-based per [base-standards.md](../../../docs/conventions/base-standards.md#livewire-component-convention-class-based-not-single-file). Composes **`ProductVariantValidationRules` only** (**D-13**), all seven methods (0029 **D-16**), of which this component uses five — the other two back 0031a's generator. **No `#[Title]`** — it is a nested child, not a page; the title stays 0027's `#[Title('Product editor')]`. Uses `WithPagination` for the variants list (**D-17**). 🔴 **Does not host the generator** — `attributeTypeIds`, `generationSummary`, `showGenerateModal` and `generateCombinations()` moved to 0031a's own copy of this class in the 2026-09-06 split (see below). |
| `resources/views/livewire/products/variant-builder.blade.php` | The **ordinary kebab-case mirror** — `VariantBuilder` is not an `Index`, so the [`Index`-in-a-subfolder exception](../../../docs/conventions/naming.md#exception-a-component-named-index-resolves-to-its-parent-folders-name) does **not** apply. Same depth as 0027's `products/editor.blade.php`. |
| `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderTest.php` | Create/update/delete orchestration, the one-unsaved-variant invariant, error-key routing. |
| `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderSkuPreviewTest.php` | The derivation as rendered: literal-string assertions, the three-way ordering fixture, submission-order irrelevance, the no-SKU-control guard. |
| `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderRenderingTest.php` | Own/inherited/none badges, the four refusal surfaces, the three Flux/Blaze regression guards, `data-test` hooks on both branches, the `@can('viewAny', Media::class)` branch, both empty states. |
| `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderQueryTest.php` | **D-6**'s corrected eager-load list, the two-axis N+1 guard, and the pagination query shape (**D-17**). |
| `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderAuthorizationTest.php` | One allow/deny pair per method, the cross-product target test, Super Admin via `Gate::before`, every deny paired with its absent side effect. |
| `tests/Browser/Products/VariantBuilderTest.php` | **Only** the real-DOM cases — see [Tests to perform](#tests-to-perform). |

> 🔴 **Note appended 2026-09-06.** `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderGeneratorTest.php` — the

### Modifies

| Path | What & why | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `resources/views/livewire/products/editor.blade.php` | The embed block plus the `products.create` callout (**D-1**). **`app/Livewire/Products/Editor.php` needs no change** — `$productId` is already in Blade scope. | 0027 |
| `lang/en/products.php`, `lang/es/products.php` | **Extend** with **D-15**'s keys, key-for-key identical. **Seventh writer** (FE-V8). | 0024 creates |
| `tests/Unit/ArchitectureTest.php` | Extend the `App\Livewire\Products\*` fence. **One `expect()` per namespace, never `expect([...])`** — that form is disjunctive and this repo has already shipped one vacuous arch rule that way (0024 **V-7**). | 0027 extends it too |

### Conditional on an open question

| Path | When |
| --- | --- |
| `app/Livewire/Products/Editor.php` (+ its view) | **OQ-7** accepted → the create-path redirect to `products.edit`; **OQ-12** accepted → the "changing this SKU re-derives N variant SKUs" notice on the SKU field |
| `app/Livewire/Products/AttributeTypes/Index.php` (+ its view, + lang) | **OQ-10** accepted → 0030's rename warning and its missing collision-error rendering. **These are amendments to 0030, not work this story performs.** |

## Tests to perform

**Layer rule, stated once.** `tests/Feature/` (`Livewire::test()`) owns everything provable from server
state — validation, authorization, persistence, query counts and rendered markup. `tests/Browser/` owns
**only** what a real DOM, a real event loop and real JS produce. Where a case appears at both layers,
each half proves something the other structurally cannot, and that is stated.

Scaffold with `php artisan make:test --pest Products/VariantBuilderTest`. Use `test()`, not `it()`; third
person; no "should".

### `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderSkuPreviewTest.php`

- [ ] Adding a variant for Talla `M` on product `0001` persists **and renders** the **literal** `'0001-M'`.
      **Never** `toBe(VariantSku::derive(...))` — 0029 **FP15**, and worse here: the component itself calls
      `derive()`, so both sides would be the same wrong value twice over (**FP-V2**).
- [ ] 🔴 **The three-way ordering fixture** (see the table below), asserting the position-ordered literal.
- [ ] **Submission order is irrelevant**: the same three values set in reverse key order produce the
      identical literal. `$combinationRows` is a PHP array whose insertion order *is* the submission
      order, so this is a faithful reproduction of the payload vector.
- [ ] **A submitted `sku` is impossible to send**: the component exposes no `sku` property
      (`Livewire::test()->set('sku', …)` fails), and the rendered form contains no `sku`-named control
      and no hidden input carrying the preview.
- [ ] Casing is preserved **in both directions** — `L` stays `L` and `azul marino` stays lowercase.
      A single all-one-case assertion cannot fail against an implementation that upper-cases (0029
      **FP14**).
- [ ] An empty combination renders the placeholder, **not** a bare parent SKU.
- [ ] **After a successful create, the rendered SKU is re-read from the database**, not the preview
      string — **D-5 R2**. Arrange by mutating the attribute value's `value` directly in the database
      between `mount()` and `addVariant()`, then assert the listed SKU is the **new** derivation. *This
      test exists nowhere else in the project.*

**The three-way ordering fixture (0029 FP16, corrected).**

> 🔵 **`frontend-qa`'s correction to 0029's own test plan.** 0029 **FP16** requires that ordering by
> position, by name and by id/creation all **disagree**, and its worked example uses **two** attribute
> types. That is arithmetically impossible: two items admit only two permutations, so position-order can
> be separated from {name, id} order, but **name-order can never be separated from id-order**. The
> fixture needs **three** types.

| Type | Created | `position` | Name | Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | 1st (earliest UUIDv7) | `2` | `Color` | `azul marino` |
| T2 | 2nd | `0` | `Acabado` | `Mate` |
| T3 | 3rd (latest UUIDv7) | `1` | `Talla` | `L` |

| Candidate ordering | Derived SKU |
| --- | --- |
| ✅ **`type.position`** (the rule) | `0002-Mate-L-azul-marino` |
| by type **name** | `0002-Mate-azul-marino-L` |
| by type **id** / creation | `0002-azul-marino-Mate-L` |
| by **submission** (T3, T1, T2) | `0002-L-azul-marino-Mate` |

All four distinct, so the test can only pass for the right reason. The value-level tail of the sort key
(`value.position, value.id`, 0029's **DIS-1** shape) is **unreachable from this UI** by construction
(**D-2**) — it stays 0029's test and this story must not claim it.

### `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderTest.php`

- [ ] A full valid payload creates exactly one variant with exactly N pivot rows, `price` asserted as the
      **string** `'19.99'` (**T12**).
- [ ] The price is **pre-filled from the parent** on create and **from the variant** on edit, byte-for-byte.
- [ ] **A duplicate combination** throws `ValidationException` on **`combination`**, and the product still
      holds exactly **one** such variant **and** exactly **N** pivot rows. 0029 **FP1**: a variant-row
      count alone passes when the row rolled back but orphan pivot rows survived.
- [ ] **`derived_sku_taken` is a different refusal**: arrange a *product* literally named `0001-M`, add
      the Talla `M` variant of product `0001`, assert the key is **`sku`** and the message **names the
      conflicting product**. 0029 **D-4.5** case (a) — no index spans the two tables, so nothing but the
      application check can produce it.
- [ ] **The discriminator**: arrange a case where **both** are true and assert the **combination** message
      wins (0029 **D-4.5**'s deliberate ordering; mislabelling is **R-F**).
- [ ] Empty-segment and over-length refusals, each on **its own** key, each writing **zero** rows and
      **zero** pivot rows.
- [ ] **The builder never holds more than one unsaved variant** — a structural invariant of **D-3**.
- [ ] `closeForm()` clears the error bag (**D-8**), proven by a refused save followed by a fresh open.
- [ ] Deleting a variant removes its row **and** its pivot rows, and the freed combination **and SKU are
      immediately re-creatable** — the UI-layer proof of 0029 **D-6**'s "no `SoftDeletes`".
- [ ] `confirmDelete()` populates the label **and SKU** from the **database** (**D-5 R3**), proven by
      mutating the value's string between `confirmDelete()` and the assertion and asserting the modal
      shows the **new** SKU.
- [ ] 🔴 **Combination immutability, proven against the method rather than the markup**: `set()` a
      different combination on an **existing** variant and `call('saveVariant')` → the pivot's value-id
      set is **byte-identical** and both `combination_hash` and `sku` are unchanged. **FP-V16**: absent
      markup is not an absent method — `/livewire/update` reaches `saveVariant()` regardless of what
      renders.

### `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderRenderingTest.php`

- [ ] A variant with no image renders the **parent's** image and the **inherited** badge; with its own
      image, its own and the **own** badge; with neither, 0027 **OQ-2**'s placeholder.
- [ ] 🔴 **The FP2 discriminator at the UI layer**: change the parent's `featured_media_id` to a different
      row, re-render, assert the inheriting variant now shows the **new** URL. A UI that snapshots the
      resolved URL at mount passes every other image test and fails only here.
- [ ] A variant created with no image persists `featured_media_id` as **literally NULL**.
- [ ] Reverting an own image sets it back to NULL and re-renders the inherited badge.
- [ ] **All four refusals are visible**, one test per key, asserting the message text **and** the
      container it renders in (**D-8** — three of four have no matching field and render nowhere by
      default).
- [ ] The combination is rendered as **static badges** on edit, with no enabled attribute control (**D-11**).
- [ ] Both empty states: no variants yet, and **no attribute types in the catalog** (with its link out).
      **FP-V17**: checking the latter only for "no exception" is a structural false positive — it passes
      even if the whole builder is broken, because nothing builder-related runs.
- [ ] **The three Flux/Blaze regression guards**: an *enabled* row action renders **no**
      `data-flux-tooltip-content` element; the disabled branch's `cursor-not-allowed!` sits on the
      `flux:tooltip` wrapper, not the button; every id in a `wire:*` argument went through `@js()`.
- [ ] Every row action carries its `data-test` hook on **both** branches.
- [ ] The Gallery embed is inside `@can('viewAny', Media::class)`, and an actor without `media.view`
      still renders the builder rather than a 403 (**T13**).
- [ ] The delete confirmation states the removal is **permanent** (**D-11**).

### `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderQueryTest.php`

- [ ] **Warm-up call first** (0029 **FP7** — the first `Gate::authorize()` cold-loads all Spatie
      permission data; copy the design at `tests/Feature/Users/IndexTest.php:218-246`), then the query
      count for 1 variant equals the count for 10.
- [ ] 🔴 **Grow the second axis too**: 10 variants each with **three** attribute values vs. 10 with one.
      **FP-V11**: growing only the variant count cannot detect an N+1 on the `values` pivot — the very
      relation **D-6** found missing from 0029's **R-D**.
- [ ] The fixture uses **distinct** related rows (a distinct own image per variant, distinct values) —
      identical ones pass through Eloquent's identity map and hide the defect.
- [ ] The eager load is **used, not merely issued**: assert the rendered combination label and thumbnail
      are correct in the same test.
- [ ] **Pagination (D-17)**: 30 variants render 25 rows on page 1 and 5 on page 2; the query count
      on page 2 equals page 1's (± the paginator's own count query, 0027 **D-4**'s allowance); and the
      **order is total across the page boundary** — page 1's last row sorts before page 2's first by
      `(position, sku)`. Arrange **tied `position` values** deliberately, or the `sku` tiebreak that
      makes pagination safe is never exercised.

### `tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderAuthorizationTest.php`

- [ ] One **allow/deny pair per method that mutates or discloses** — `openCreateForm`, `openEditForm`,
      `saveVariant`, `confirmDelete`, `deleteVariant` and `setVariantImage` — driven through
      `Livewire::test()` as the acting user. A route-level 403 never reaches these: `/livewire/update`
      re-runs only the `PersistentMiddleware` allow-list. 🔴 `generateCombinations()`'s own
      allow/deny pair moved to [0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)'s own copy of this file.
- [ ] **Every deny paired with its absent side effect** (0029 **FP5**: an `AuthorizationException` raised
      *after* the write still throws).
- [ ] 🔴 **The cross-product target test**: as an actor allowed on product X, call `deleteVariant()` with a
      variant id belonging to product Y → refused, **and Y's variant still exists**. If the method
      resolves the parent from the client-held `$productId` rather than from `$variant->product`, an
      actor authorised on X is authorised for a delete on Y. **0029 cannot write this test (no
      component) and 0027 cannot (no variants) — it exists only here.**
- [ ] A `Super Admin` holding **zero** permission rows passes every one via `Gate::before`.
- [ ] `Gate::forUser($denied)->authorize(...)` **throws** — not merely `allows()` returning false.
- [ ] Permission-cache staleness: warm by asserting `true`, revoke via a role change, re-assert on a
      **freshly resolved** user, with **no** `forgetCachedPermissions()` between Act and Assert.
- [ ] **Named exception classes everywhere** — never `->throws(Exception::class)`, which
      `PermissionDoesNotExist` from an unseeded catalog satisfies (0029 **FP6**).
- [ ] `$canManageVariants` comes from the **same** policy method the mutating paths authorize against, so
      the disabled state cannot drift (**D-10** note 4).

### `tests/Browser/Products/VariantBuilderTest.php`

Deliberately few, per [coverage-policy.md](../../../docs/testing/frontend/coverage-policy.md) and 0027
**R-6**. Each names the thing no server-side test can see.

- [ ] 🔴 **B1 — the null-`<select>` detector.** `assertScript("…selectedIndex", 0)` on every attribute
      select immediately after the form renders, **before any interaction** (**D-9**). This is the
      root-cause assertion and the only one that cannot be fooled.
- [ ] 🔴 **B2 — the live preview, with a non-identity value.** Pick Color `Marrón`, assert the DOM preview
      reads exactly `0002-Marron`, then add the variant and assert the **persisted** SKU is the same
      literal. **The single highest-value test in this story**: two bugs die here and only here — a
      missing `.live` modifier (invisible at component level, **FP-V4**) and a JS re-implementation of
      the formula (which gets `M`/`L`/`azul marino` right and `Marrón` wrong, so **every naive fixture
      passes it**).
- [ ] **B3 — the dependent-select reset (T2)**, driven by genuine clicks, asserting the **persisted**
      value. The fixture's type must offer **at least two real values**, or both implementations end on
      the same value and the test cannot fail.
- [ ] **B4 — cross-instance image routing.** With two variants listed, open the gallery for one, confirm,
      and assert the other variant, the product's **featured image** and the product's **gallery strip**
      are all untouched. Four Gallery instances now share one page (**D-6**); instance separation is a
      page-global event-name game resolved only in the browser.
- [ ] **B5 — in-page inheritance reactivity.** Change the **product's** featured image **without
      reloading** and assert the inheriting variant's thumbnail follows. **FP-V8**: changing it and then
      *reloading* re-runs `mount()` and passes against a snapshot implementation — the reload is the
      false pass.
- [ ] **B6 — each of D-4.5's three collision messages is *visible***, and it is the right one for each
      case (**R-F**).
- [ ] **B7 — the disabled row action** does not respond to a click, its `data-test` hook is present on
      both branches, and the tooltip appears on hover of the **`ui-tooltip` wrapper** (the button is
      `pointer-events-none`), while an **enabled** row renders **no** `data-flux-tooltip-content`.
- [ ] **B8 — `assertNoJavaScriptErrors()` after every step** of a full journey: open the editor, open the
      form, change each select, add a variant, open the gallery, confirm, open the delete modal, cancel,
      confirm.

> 🔴 **B9 and B10 moved to [0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)** with the rest of the
> generator UI — the generate modal's `<dialog>` safety (B9) and the live combination count updating on
> genuine checkbox clicks (B10). B8's journey no longer extends into the generator; 0031a's own browser
> file extends its own journey instead.

**Deliberately not in the browser suite:** every validation refusal's *rule* (component-level — re-driving
a server rule through Chromium costs 30× for no new signal), the authorization matrix, query counts, and
the ordering fixture.

### Assertions that would be false passes if written naively

**FP-V1 — the SKU preview asserted with a page-wide `assertSee`.** The parent's SKU, the preview and
every listed variant's SKU are on one page, so `assertSee('0001-M')` passes when the preview is blank and
a *listed* variant happens to carry it. Scope it to `[data-test=variant-sku-preview]`.

**FP-V2 — asserting a SKU by re-calling `VariantSku::derive()`.** 0029 **FP15** at one remove, and worse:
the component itself calls `derive()`, so the assertion compares the function against itself. **Every SKU
assertion in this story is a hand-written literal.**

**FP-V3 — the ordering fixture built from two attribute types.** Arithmetically cannot separate
name-order from id-order. Three types (above).

**FP-V4 — "the preview updates live", asserted at component level.** `Livewire::test()->set()` syncs the
property whether or not the view carries `.live`. A deferred binding passes every component test and
never moves a character in a real browser.

**FP-V5 — "no SKU is posted back", asserted by "the stored SKU is correct".** 0029 **D-4.3** makes the
action *ignore* a submitted `sku`, so the stored value is right in both worlds. Assert the **markup**.

**FP-V6 — a refusal asserted by "the modal stayed open" or a substring like `assertSee('already')`.**
Four distinct refusals reach this screen. Assert the specific key **and** where it renders.

**FP-V7 — duplicate-combination refusal asserted by variant row count alone** (0029 **FP1**). Assert the
pivot count too.

**FP-V8 — the inheritance test that changes the parent's image and then reloads.** The reload is the
false pass; only an in-session change discriminates.

**FP-V9 — a deny test asserting only that an exception was thrown**, and its UI twin: **asserting that
the button renders disabled**. A disabled button proves nothing about the method —
`/livewire/update` reaches it directly. Pair every disabled-hint assertion with a `Livewire::test()` call
of the same method as the same actor, plus the absent side effect.

**FP-V10 — `->throws(Exception::class)` in a permission test** (0029 **FP6**).

**FP-V11 — the N+1 test that grows only the variant count.** Cannot see the `values` pivot N+1.

**FP-V12 — variant-list ordering asserted with three `assertSee` calls.** They pass in any DOM order
(0029 **FP8**). Assert the exact sequence.

**FP-V13 — an enabled row action tested without a *negative* assertion on the Blaze tooltip.** The
conditionally-bound `tooltip` prop renders an empty bubble on every **enabled** row and breaks no text
assertion.

**FP-V14 — any `->select()`-driven test claimed as coverage for the null-desync.** Verified impossible
(**QA-V1**). This also invalidates the stated rationale of a **shipped** test (**QA-V2** / **R-3**).

**FP-V15 — a translated refusal asserted against a hardcoded English literal.** `APP_LOCALE=en` today;
the assertion rots silently under Epic 5. Use `__('products.variants.…')`. **The inverse holds for the
SKU: never `__()` there, always a literal.**

**FP-V16 — combination immutability proven only by the absent markup.** Absent markup is not an absent
method.

**FP-V17 — the "no attribute types" empty state checked only for "no exception".** Passes even if the
whole builder is broken.

**FP-V18 — a test that arranges a SKU collision by *passing a SKU*.** There is no such input. Collisions
are arranged by choosing the **fixture**; name the intended case (a/b/c per 0029 **D-4.5**) in the test
name, or the next reader cannot tell which one a fixture constructs.

### Test-arrangement notes for Phase 3

- `beforeEach` in authorization files: `app(PermissionRegistrar::class)->forgetCachedPermissions();`
  **then** `$this->seed(RolePermissionSeeder::class);` — both halves load-bearing. **Never** flush between
  Act and Assert.
- Do **not** invoke the full `DatabaseSeeder` to arrange (it creates a `test@example.com` fixture user).
- **Pin any config a test depends on**, including setting it to `null` when "unset" is the assumed state
  (the task-0003 lesson in [errors-log.md](../../../docs/errors-log.md)).
- The browser suite runs **Chromium only** in CI ([playwright-setup.md](../../../docs/testing/frontend/playwright-setup.md)).

### Deliberately not tested here

| Not tested here | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| The derivation formula itself, `segment()`, the combination hash, the collision matrix, re-derivation cascades | 0029 |
| The generator's UI and **behaviour** — the cartesian expansion, iteration order, savepoint isolation, `MAX_COMBINATIONS`, the empty-type refusal, the one-query duplicate pre-read, and a generated variant's price/stock/NULL image | 0031a / 0029b |
| The referential-integrity FKs and the two attribute in-use guards | 0029 |
| The `DIS-1` two-values-of-one-type ordering tail (unreachable from this UI by construction) | 0029 |
| The product's own fields, list, delete, region picker and WYSIWYG | 0027 |
| The gallery's search, upload, tile cap and detail editing | 0019 / 0020 |
| The attribute-type/value repeater's own behaviour | 0030 |

## Expected outcome

A catalog administrator editing a saved product sees a **Variantes** section beneath the product form.
It lists every variant with its combination, its **stored** SKU, price, stock and a thumbnail badged
*Propia* or *Heredada* — an inheriting variant showing the product's own featured image, resolved at
read time, so changing the product's image changes what those variants show while a variant with its own
image is untouched.

Adding a variant is a form of paired attribute-type/value selects. As values are picked, the SKU
**appears and updates live** — `0001-M`, then `0002-azul-marino-L` — computed on the server by the one
`VariantSku::derive()` definition, ordered by the attribute types' own configured order rather than by
the order the administrator clicked, and rendered as read-only text. **There is no SKU field anywhere on
the screen**, nothing carrying a SKU is ever posted back, and once the variant is saved the list shows
the value the catalog actually stored rather than the text that was previewed.

A duplicate combination, a SKU some product already holds, an attribute value that reduces to nothing,
and an over-long derivation are each refused **visibly and distinguishably** — the SKU collision naming
the conflicting record and the two remedies the administrator can act on, since the SKU is not something
they can retype. An existing variant's price, stock and image are editable while its combination is shown
as fixed; changing a combination means removing the variant and building it again, behind a confirmation
that names the target and says the removal is permanent.

The list is paginated — 25 rows at a time (**D-17**) — with a total order that holds across the page
boundary, so a product large enough to need it is never a performance surprise.

🔴 **Building them one at a time is the whole of this story.** Building a whole cartesian product at once
— a "Generar combinaciones" control, its axis picker and its outcome summary — is
**[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)**'s screen, sequenced immediately after this one; that
story's own Expected Outcome describes it.

Every one of this story's operations authorizes against the **parent product** before it does anything,
and an administrator who may view but not edit sees each action rendered disabled with an explanation.

Structurally: 0029's **three** single-variant actions, `ProductVariant`, `VariantSku`/`DeriveVariantSku`,
`VariantCombination`/`HashVariantCombination` and `ProductPolicy`'s variant coverage acquire their
**first** call sites here (0029's own actions are already self-authorizing, so this is defence in depth
rather than the only layer — **D-10**); `GenerateProductVariantCombinations` acquires its first UI call
site in 0031a instead. Epic 2's product arc closes once both stories ship.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] `App\Livewire\Products\VariantBuilder` exists as a **nested child** of 0027's editor, rendered only
      when the product is saved, with **no new route** and no sidebar entry.
- [ ] On `products/create` the builder is replaced by a notice that the product must be saved first.
- [ ] The variants list renders combination, stored SKU, price, stock and a thumbnail, ordered
      deterministically and asserted as an exact sequence, with an explicit empty state — and a second,
      distinct empty state when the catalog holds no attribute types.
- [ ] **A variant's SKU is previewed live as attribute values are chosen**, computed **server-side** by
      `VariantSku::derive()`, matching the literals `0001-M`, `0002-azul-marino` and
      `0002-azul-marino-L`, in the attribute types' `position` order regardless of the order the values
      were picked.
- [ ] **There is no SKU input of any kind** — no field, no `readonly` input, no hidden field, and no
      public `sku` property on the component — and nothing carrying a SKU is posted back.
- [ ] **The formula is not re-implemented client-side**, proven by a browser test using an attribute
      value whose `segment()` is not the identity (`Marrón` → `0002-Marron`).
- [ ] **After a successful create, the listed SKU is re-read from the database**, never the previewed
      string, and the variants list is a `#[Computed]` over a query rather than a `mount()`-time array.
- [ ] **A duplicate combination is refused visibly** on the `combination` key, with the product still
      holding exactly one such variant **and** exactly N pivot rows.
- [ ] **Every one of 0029 D-15's six bag keys relevant to this screen renders somewhere the
      administrator can see** — the four SKU refusals distinguishable from one another **by message**,
      plus `combination` and `attributeValueIds` and `featuredMediaId` — with the SKU collision naming
      the conflicting record and the two available remedies. **All six render nowhere unless rendered
      explicitly** — none of them is a bound `wire:model` path on this screen.
- [ ] **The variants list paginates at 25** with a total order (`position ASC, sku ASC`) that holds
      across the page boundary.
- [ ] **A variant with no own image renders the parent's featured image and is badged as inherited** —
      proven by a test that changes the parent's image and observes the variant follow — while
      `featured_media_id` stays NULL; a variant with its own image is unaffected; and an own image can be
      reverted to inherited.
- [ ] The variant image is picked through **one** `media.gallery` instance in single-select mode with its
      own distinct `select-event`, and a selection for one variant reaches no other variant, nor the
      product's featured image, nor its gallery strip.
- [ ] **An existing variant's combination cannot be changed** — proven against the *method*, not only the
      markup — while price, stock and image are editable.
- [ ] Removing a variant is behind a confirmation naming the target and stating that it is **permanent**,
      and the freed combination and SKU are immediately re-creatable.
- [ ] **Every one of the six methods that mutate or disclose calls `Gate::authorize()` against the
      parent product as its first statement**, each with an allow and a deny test, each deny paired with
      its absent side effect — including the cross-product target test. (A seventh, `generateCombinations`,
      is [0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)'s own.)
- [ ] The disabled-action hint comes from the **same** policy method the mutating path authorizes
      against, computed once rather than per row.
- [ ] The variants query eager-loads `featuredImage` **and `values.type`**, with no N+1 as either the
      variant count or the values-per-variant count grows.
- [ ] Every errors-log trap is honoured: no `wire:model`-bound value is ever `null` or absent, both
      placeholders are `disabled`, the dependent value select resets on a type change, `@js()` wraps every
      id in a `wire:*` argument, the disabled tooltip is a written-out branch, and `cursor-not-allowed!`
      sits on the wrapper.
- [ ] `lang/en/products.php` and `lang/es/products.php` are **extended** key-for-key identically, and no
      user-facing string is hardcoded.
- [ ] No migration, model, action, policy, enum, validation rule, factory, seeder, route or
      permission-catalog change is added by this story.
- [ ] Pint clean and Larastan level 7 clean.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Tests written and green, plus the **full** existing suite in a single isolated run, per
      [contracts.md](../../../docs/contracts.md)'s Full Test Suite Gate Rule.
- [ ] `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` clean and Larastan level 7 passing.
- [ ] Code reviewed (code-reviewer).
- [ ] **No security findings (appsec-auditor). Point the audit at five things specifically:** (1) that no
      SKU value is reachable from the client in any form — no property, no hidden field, no `disabled`
      input that still posts; (2) that the preview's attribute-value **strings** are read back from the
      database and never taken from the payload (0029 **V-10**, of which this preview is a third
      consumer); (3) `#[Locked]` placement on `$productId`, `$editingVariantId`, `$deletingVariantId` and
      every id-carrying property, each assigned from a value read out of the database; (4) that
      `Gate::authorize()` targets `$variant->product` **re-read from the variant**, never the
      client-held `$productId` — the cross-product escalation the authorization test pins; and (5) the
      `@js()` encoding of every id in a `wire:*` argument.
- [ ] **Documentation updated (docs-keeper)**, with four specific items beyond the usual:
      `docs/api/routes.md`'s `products.edit` entry gains the embedded builder and its **fourth** gallery
      instance (0027 **D-8**'s table currently says three);
      `docs/architecture/authorization.md` records that `ProductPolicy` now covers variants **and has
      call sites for them**; **and the errors-log gains the `->select()` finding** described in **R-3**
      below — that Playwright's `selectOption` fires `change` unconditionally, so no `->select()`-driven
      test can be the regression net for the 2026-08-16 null-desync entry, and
      `tests/Browser/UsersIndexTest.php`'s comment claiming otherwise is wrong. The `assertScript`
      `selectedIndex` detector is the rule that replaces it.
- [ ] **Hand-offs discharged, recorded explicitly**: 0029 **D-12**'s zero-call-site enforcement gap for
      the **three** single-variant actions (now self-authorizing per 0029's own **D-12.1**, with this
      story's gates as defence in depth — **D-10**) + `ProductPolicy`'s variant coverage, and 0029's own
      Definition-of-Done bullet *"render the variant SKU as read-only"*. Each is a checkbox in 0029's
      DoD; name which one this story satisfied. `GenerateProductVariantCombinations`'s own zero-call-site
      hand-off is discharged by **0031a**, not here.
- [ ] **0029's four 2026-08-19 hand-offs discharged**, each named in its DoD: **(a)** OQ-3
      **closed rather than re-debated** (done — see the [amendment note](#documented-functional-decisions));
      **(b)** every bag key relevant to this screen rendered explicitly (**D-8**'s six-row table);
      **(c)**/**(d)** the generator's own action-name and summary-rendering hand-offs are
      **[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)**'s to discharge, not this story's.
- [ ] **Amendments raised on other stories, not silently performed here**: **OQ-7** and **OQ-12** on
      **0027**; **OQ-10** on **0030**; ~~**OQ-3**~~ (**discharged** — 0029 **D-15**–**D-17.2**),
      **OQ-5** and ~~**OQ-6**~~ (**discharged** — resolved in **D-16a**; the only thing left on
      0029 is the *conditional* `ReorderProductVariants`, which is raised **only if** the PO wants
      manual ordering) on **0029**. Every remaining one is to a story still in the `new` stage and
      therefore free to amend — but each must be *carried back*, not fixed in this story's Phase 3.
- [ ] **[OQ-1](#open-questions) answered before Phase 3 starts** — it is now the **only** blocking
      question, and it changes six `Gate::authorize()` lines plus a fixture. **OQ-2 and OQ-3 are
      resolved** and no longer block anything; **[OQ-13](#open-questions)** (the paginator's
      page size) is a one-constant answer that can be given during Phase 3 without reopening a design.
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met.

## Dependencies, findings and risks

### Verified findings

Executed against this repository on 2026-08-18 during this debate. `FE-` are `frontend-expert`'s, `QA-`
are `frontend-qa`'s, `PO-` are `product-owner`'s own.

| # | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| **FE-V2** | `livewire/livewire` **4.3.3**, `livewire/flux` **2.15.0** (Free), `livewire/blaze` **1.0.12**, `laravel/framework` **13.19.0**, PHP **8.5.0**. |
| **FE-V3** | **Flux Free 2.15.0 has no `tabs`, no `combobox`, no `accordion`, no repeater primitive.** Drives **D-1** (section, not tabs) and **D-2** (hand-rolled repeater). |
| **FE-V4** 🔴 | **`flux:select`'s only variant renders a native `<select>`**, and its stub declares `'name' => $attributes->whereStartsWith('wire:model')->first()` then `$invalid ??= ($name && $errors->has($name))`. Two consequences: the errors-log desync trap applies at the source, **and a Flux field only auto-renders an error whose bag key exactly equals its `wire:model` path**. Decisive for **D-1** and **D-8**. |
| **FE-V5** 🔴 | **`flux:modal` renders a native `<dialog>`** inside `<ui-modal>`. 0027 **D-1** reason 1 is grounded in the real implementation. Drives **D-12**. |
| **FE-V6** | Livewire 4.3.3 **does** ship islands (`@island`/`@endisland`), with **zero** usages in this repo today. Recorded so **D-1**'s rejection of (D) is "not for this" rather than "not available". |
| **FE-V8** 🔴 | `lang/en/` and `lang/es/` contain **only `users.php`**. `products.php` does not exist; this story is its **seventh** writer. |
| **FE-V10** | `resources/views/livewire/users.blade.php` carries both Flux/Blaze trap comments verbatim. The house pattern to copy character-for-character. |
| **FE-V11** 🔴 | **The prototype contains no variants UI at all** — `grep -io "variante?s?\|atributos?\|combinaci[oó]n\|talla"` across `docs/arospe-handoff/project/` returns only three incidental `talla` hits in JS sample data. *(Independently found by `frontend-qa` as its **V-7**.)* |
| **FE-V12** | **PRD §2.2's variants block has exactly one creation scenario and it is singular** — *"When they generate the variant 'Size 40 / Color Black'"*. No bulk scenario anywhere. Load-bearing for **D-3**. |
| **FE-V14** | `flux/select/index.blade.php` and `flux/modal/index.blade.php` both open with `@blaze(fold: true, …)` — **Blaze folding is live on the exact components this screen is built from**. |
| **QA-V1** 🔴 | **`->select()` provably cannot detect the null-`<select>` desync.** `InteractsWithElements::select()` is a one-line pass-through to Playwright's `selectOption`, whose injected implementation does `select.value = void 0`, sets `option.selected = true`, then dispatches `input` **and** `change` **unconditionally**. *(Re-verified by `product-owner`: `InteractsWithElements.php:117-122` is literally `$this->guessLocator($field)->selectOption($option);`.)* |
| **QA-V2** 🔴 | **A shipped test in this repo makes a claim QA-V1 falsifies.** `tests/Browser/UsersIndexTest.php:114-117` argues that picking the first option *"is the only choice that actually exercises the fix"*. It is not. *(Re-verified by `product-owner` — the comment is at those exact lines.)* See **R-3**. |
| **QA-V3** | **`assertValue()` / `assertSelected()` cannot distinguish the two states either** — both resolve to Playwright's `inputValue()` → `select.value`, which returns `''` for a correctly-selected disabled placeholder **and** for `selectedIndex === -1`. |
| **QA-V4** 🟢 | **`assertScript(string $expression, mixed $expected = true)` exists** (`MakesElementAssertions.php:155`) and strict-compares against a live-page `evaluate()`. *(Re-verified by `product-owner`.)* This is what makes **D-9**'s detector possible. |
| **QA-V5** 🟢 | **Flux derives a select's `name` from its `wire:model` expression**, so `wire:model.live="combinationRows.0.typeId"` yields `name="combinationRows.0.typeId"` — a contract-derived selector needing **no new `data-test` hook**. *(Re-verified by `product-owner` at `select/variants/default.blade.php:3,39`.)* |
| **QA-V6** | Pest's `@`-prefixed selector resolves to `[data-testid=…], [data-test=…]`, and a bare string falls back to `[id]` → `[name]` → `getByText`. So both selector styles above work with no plumbing. |
| **QA-V9** | `CannotUpdateLockedPropertyException` exists, so "a locked property cannot be set from the client" is a nameable assertion. |
| **QA-V10** | The N+1 warm-up idiom is real and citable at `tests/Feature/Users/IndexTest.php:218-246`. |
| **PO-V1** | **Nothing in the dependency chain exists in code.** `app/Models/` holds `Role.php` + `User.php`; `app/Livewire/` holds `Actions/`, `Settings/`, `Settings/TwoFactor/`, `Users/`; `resources/views/livewire/` holds `auth/`, `settings/`, `users.blade.php`; `database/migrations/` holds 15 users-era files. **This story's entire interface contract is documented, not shipped** — 0027's **V-9** extended by four more stories. |
| **PO-V2** | **`ProductVariantValidationRules`' entity-prefixed method names were chosen for this story specifically.** 0029's files table says the prefixes exist *"because a variant editor composing this alongside `ProductValidationRules` fatals on a duplicate method"*. **D-13**'s "compose one trait only" is what makes the prefixes unnecessary in practice — they remain the safety net. |
| **PO-V3** | **No `product_product_attribute_type` table is specified anywhere.** 0029's **OQ-5a** parks it in "0030/0031"; 0030 shipped without it. So the declaration table is genuinely **unowned**, which is why **D-3** must fence it explicitly rather than inherit a decision. |

### Dependencies

Hard and blocking, in required order:
**0019 → 0020 → 0021 → 0022 → 0023 → 0024 → 0026 → 0027 → 0028 → 0029 → 0030 → 0031.**

Already-shipped work relied on: the seeded `products.*` permissions (0002), the `Gate::before` Super
Admin bypass and policy auto-discovery (0004), the Users list+modal+disabled-row-action pattern (0006),
and the wired-up browser suite (0006b).

### Risks

- **R-1 — 🔴 There is no design reference for this screen (FE-V11 / QA-V7).** Every other Epic 2 screen
  could settle an information-architecture argument by pointing at
  `docs/arospe-handoff/project/*.html` — 0027 **D-1** did exactly that, three times. The prototype
  contains **no variants UI whatsoever**. Every IA choice in **D-1**, **D-2**, **D-6**, **D-11** and
  **D-12** is argued from the backend contract, from PRD text and from this repo's precedents. **Phase 2
  should treat them as decisions to confirm, not as renderings of something already designed.**
- **R-2 — The SKU preview is the story's central mechanism and its failure modes are all silent.** A
  missing `.live`, a JS re-implementation, or a preview built from a stale option list each produce a
  screen that looks right. Mitigated by **D-4**, **D-5** and browser test **B2**; **not eliminated**.
- **R-3 — 🔴 The project's belief about how the null-`<select>` desync is tested is wrong (QA-V1/QA-V2).**
  A shipped test claims to be a regression net it cannot be. This story does not fix that test (out of
  scope), but it must not copy its reasoning, and the correction is a Definition-of-Done docs item.
- **R-4 — Four hand-rolled JS surfaces become five.** 0027 **R-6** already flags the featured gallery,
  the strip gallery, the WYSIWYG's internal gallery and the region picker running together for the first
  time. This story adds a fourth Gallery instance and a live-updating repeater to the same page.
- ~~**R-5 — Three real contract gaps in 0029**~~ 🟣 **CLOSED 2026-08-19.** All four (the count was
  four, not three, once `ProductAttributeValue::type()` was included) were amended into 0029 the same
  day: **D-15** the error-bag keys, **D-16** the trait including `variantFeaturedMediaIdRules()`,
  **D-17.1** the action signatures, **D-17.2** the named relations. The risk was *"cheap to amend now,
  expensive mid-Phase-3"* and it was taken while cheap. **The residual is one line, not zero**: 0029's
  amendment also revealed that this story had under-counted the unbound bag keys (five, not three), so
  **D-8**'s rendering obligation grew rather than shrank.
- ~~**R-6 — `position` is specified but not writable.**~~ 🟣 **RESOLVED 2026-08-19, and it was two
  risks wearing one name** — see **[D-16a](#d-16a--oq-6-resolved-variant-row-order-and-images-need-no-reorder-control-in-v1)**.
  The **image** half turned out not to exist: a variant has exactly one optional `featured_media_id`
  and 0029 rejects a variant gallery outright, so 0027's `SyncProductGallery` shape — a column whose
  reorder cannot be expressed through the published action signature — **has nothing to attach to
  here**. The **row-order** half is real, is accepted, and is now benign: `CreateProductVariant` writes
  `position` in a deliberately useful order (and, if 0031a's generator ships too, so does its own
  cartesian sequence) and this story ships **no reorder control**. It reopens only if a merchandising
  order is wanted, and then it starts with a `ReorderProductVariants` amendment on 0029 — described in
  **D-16a**, deliberately **not** designed here.
- 🔴 **R-11 and R-12 — the generator's own risks (table-scale DOM weight, and its happiest path being its
  least-tested one) moved to [0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)** with the rest of the
  generator UI in the 2026-09-06 split. Neither is a risk to this story's own screen.
- **R-7 — Seven writers on `lang/*/products.php`** (FE-V8). 0027's **R-7** at more than double the scale;
  a key missing from `lang/es` renders as its own raw key with no error.
- **R-8 — `price` is a string, not a float** (0024 **R-4**, 0029 **R-C**). `@property float` and
  `if ($variant->price > 100)` both read as correct and both are wrong. `toBe('19.99')`, with quotes.
- **R-9 — CI cannot open a database connection** (`ci-database-connection-gap.md`, still open). Inherited
  at its largest scale: this story's closure evidence spans feature **and** browser suites and can only
  come from a local run until that is fixed.
- **R-10 — Modelling this screen on Users.** Two specific over-reaches: a per-row authorization matrix
  (every ability answers identically — **D-10** note 4) and re-running 0029's validation suite one layer
  up.

## Open questions

~~Eleven. **OQ-1, OQ-2 and OQ-3 block Phase 3**; OQ-2 additionally changes this story's classification.~~

🟣 **Updated 2026-08-19. Twelve, of which three are resolved and one is new.** **OQ-2**, **OQ-3** and
**OQ-6** are **RESOLVED** — struck at the head, kept in place with their resolution recorded, because
the reasoning that produced each is what the amended contract is built on. **OQ-1 is now the only
question that blocks Phase 3.** **OQ-5** is narrowed rather than answered. **OQ-13** is new and does not
block. This story's classification did **not** change (see [Type](#type)).

> 🔵 **Bookkeeping note, not a question.** **OQ-12** is referenced twice in this document — in
> [Files → Conditional on an open question](#conditional-on-an-open-question) and in
> [Provenance](#provenance), as *"the 'changing this SKU re-derives N variant SKUs' notice on 0027's SKU
> field"*, with an *"(a) option"* — but was never written out in this section. It is a **0027**
> amendment either way; the new question below is numbered **OQ-13** so the dangling reference is not
> silently re-pointed at unrelated content.

**⚠️ OQ-1 — Confirm 0029's OQ-12: which ability gates variant create and delete?** 0029 recommends
**`products.edit` for all three** variant operations, on the reasoning that adding or removing a variant
is a *modification of an existing catalog record*. This story binds to it in **six** `Gate::authorize()`
calls and its whole authorization fixture. **Recommended: confirm as-is.** If it flips to
`products.create` / `products.delete`, six lines and one test file change.

**✅ ~~OQ-2~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-19: the cartesian generator is IN SCOPE, option (b).**
*(was: the largest scope question, and it re-classifies this story — see
[D-3](#d-3--single-variant-creation-only-the-cartesian-generator-is-a-named-scope-fence-with-a-named-backend-cost),
superseded at the time and restored 2026-09-06;
the UI was specified there until the 2026-09-06 split moved it to
[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md#d-17--the-cartesian-generator-ui))*

Options (a) and (c) are recorded as **not taken**: (a) is superseded by the PO's decision (**FE-V12**
survives as a *finding* — the PRD still has no bulk scenario — but stops being an argument), and (c)
(N best-effort calls with the administrator owning the cleanup) is precisely what 0029 **D-18.2**'s
outer transaction was built to avoid.

**✅ ~~OQ-3~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-19: all four contract gaps filled by 0029, exactly as recommended.**
*(was: four contract gaps in 0029 that 0031 cannot fill itself; all four cheap now, expensive during
Phase 3 — and they were taken while cheap)*

| Gap | Recommended | 0029's answer | Bound here in |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (a) the bag key for `derived_sku_empty_segment` / `derived_sku_too_long` | `sku`, so all three render in one place | ✅ **`sku`** — all **four** SKU refusals share it, *"distinguished by their translation key, never by their bag key"*. 0029 published the complete **six**-key table | [**D-8**](#d-8--where-every-refusal-renders-and-why-none-of-them-renders-on-its-own) |
| (b) no `variantFeaturedMediaIdRules()` | 0029 adds the one method | ✅ added, `['nullable','string',Rule::exists('media','id')]`, and the whole trait written out — **seven** methods, still **no** `skuRules()` | [**D-13**](#d-13--price-and-stock-strings-pre-filled-and-identical-in-shape-to-0027s) |
| (c) the action signatures are never written down | named scalars, `string $price`, `ProductVariant` return | ✅ **four** signatures fixed (the generator is the fourth, 0031a's own) — named scalars over an `array $data` bag *"so a literal whitelist is structural rather than disciplinary"* | [**D-13a**](#d-13a--the-confirmed-action-surface-this-component-calls-single-variant-actions) |
| (d) `ProductAttributeValue`'s value→type relation is unnamed | `type()` | ✅ **`type(): BelongsTo`**, plus every other relation this contract referred to only in prose | [**D-6**](#d-6--inheritance-is-rendered-and-labelled-null-is-the-flag-and-it-stays-null) |

> **Two things the resolution added that the question did not ask for**, both of which change work here:
> the create action's array parameter is `$productAttributeValueIds` while its **bag key stays
> `attributeValueIds`** (**D-13a** point 1 — do not harmonise them), and **`attributeValueIds` and
> `featuredMediaId` are also unbound on this screen**, which this story had not noticed. **D-8**'s
> table grew from four rows to six and its headline count from three to four.

**OQ-4 — What does the preview show for a partially-chosen combination?**
- **(a) The derivation of the completed rows, explicitly labelled provisional _(recommended)_** — it is
  the only option that teaches **D-4.2**'s mid-string insertion before it surprises anyone.
- (b) Nothing until every row is complete. Simpler, but there is no "complete" to define under **D-3**:
  without a declaration table, any non-empty subset is a legitimate variant, so a one-row combination is
  not partial at all. This is why (a) is recommended despite (b) being the more conservative-looking
  answer.
- (c) The parent SKU alone. **Excluded** — `0002` is a real product SKU and would read as the variant's.

**OQ-5 — Should there be an *advisory* pre-save SKU-conflict check?** Because the preview is live but the
collision check only runs at save, an administrator can watch a preview form and then be refused.
- **(a) Yes, but only if 0029 exposes a read-only seam _(recommended)_** — e.g.
  `VariantSku::conflictFor(string $sku, ?string $ignoreVariantId): ?array`, so the cross-table query
  exists **once**. Without it the builder would hand-write **D-4.5**'s two-table query, which is exactly
  the second-copy drift **R-L** warns about.
- (b) No — accept the save-time refusal, which **D-8**'s remedy hint already makes actionable.
- (c) Yes, with the query written in the component. **Not recommended.**

> 🟣 **Narrowed 2026-08-19, still open, and now larger in one direction and smaller in another.** 0029
> **D-18.7** considered the dry-run seam and **declined it**, leaving it here by name. Two updates:
> **(i)** the single-variant case is unchanged and (a) remains the recommendation; **(ii)** the
> *generator* no longer needs it as badly as **OQ-2**(b) assumed, because its `skipped`/`refused`

> combinations learns about a collision only afterwards. **Recommendation unchanged — (a), and only if
> 0029 exposes the read-only seam**; it is now a smaller prize than it was this morning.

**✅ ~~OQ-6~~ — RESOLVED 2026-08-19: no reorder control, and half the question turned out not to
exist.** Full reasoning in
[**D-16a**](#d-16a--oq-6-resolved-variant-row-order-and-images-need-no-reorder-control-in-v1); the
original question and its three options are kept below.

> **Resolution, in two halves.**
>
> **Variant images — the question does not apply.** Checked against 0029's schema rather than assumed:
> a variant has **exactly one optional own image** (`featured_media_id`, a single nullable FK —
> [0029 **D-5**](../done/0029-product-variants-backend.md#d-5--exact-schema)), and 0029 **D-9** rejects a
> variant gallery outright (*"PRD says 'an optional image', singular"*), repeating it in its scope
> fences as *"no `product_variant_media` gallery"*. **There is no multi-image strip on a variant,
> therefore no order, therefore nothing to reorder** — so 0024's `SyncProductGallery` ordered-array /
> index-position pattern has no surface to be applied to here, and the 0027-class bug **R-6** compared
> this to is *structurally absent* rather than deferred. **Reordering does not apply to a single-image
> field. Closed.**
>
> **Variant row order — option (c), and it is no longer "the worst of both".** 0029's amendment gave
> `position` two real writers (`MAX(position) + 1` on create, and the generator's cartesian sequence —
> [**D-18.6**](../done/0029b-product-variant-combination-generator-backend.md#d-g6--input-rules-and-the-ordering-of-what-gets-generated-0029s-d-186)),
> so it is no longer the dead schema option (b) was aimed at. 0029 declined to add
> `ReorderProductVariants` (**D-18.7**) and records that no call site passes `UpdateProductVariant`'s
> `?int $position` (**D-17.1** point 5). **This story therefore ships no reorder affordance**, and must
> not fake one by calling the update action N times — that is the pairwise-swap corruption 0029 **D-8**
> forbids. The follow-up 0029 would need if a merchandising order is ever wanted is **described, not
> designed**, in **D-16a**.

*Original question, retained:* **Confirm 0029's OQ-11 (`position` on variants) — and note it is not
expressible today.** 🔴 If `position` ships, a reorder needs a **whole-set rewrite in one transaction**
(0029 **D-8**, inheriting 0024 **D-8**'s "never pairwise swaps"). **0029 ships no
`ReorderProductVariants`, and `UpdateProductVariant` writes one row at a time** — so a reorder would be
N transactions, i.e. pairwise-equivalent.
- (a) **0029 adds `ReorderProductVariants(Product $product, array $orderedIds): void`** and 0031 ships
  move-earlier / move-later **buttons** _(was recommended; **not taken** — 0029 declined the action)_ —
  buttons rather than drag for 0027 **D-9b**'s reasons verbatim (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.7 requires a non-drag
  path anyway, and Flux Free ships nothing draggable). **Still the right shape if it is ever revisited.**
- (b) **OQ-11 resolves to not shipping the column** — a column no UI writes is dead schema by 0028
  **D8**'s own test, and UUIDv7 makes `ORDER BY id` creation order for free. **Not taken:** the column
  now has two backend writers, so its premise no longer holds.
- (c) Ship the column, ship no control — ~~the worst of both~~. ✅ **Taken**, and the judgement is
  withdrawn: with the generator populating `position` in the order the administrator wants to read,
  the absent control costs nothing.

**OQ-7 — Should 0027's create path redirect to `products.edit` instead of `products.index`?**
**(a) Yes _(recommended)_** — otherwise "create a product, then add its variants" bounces the
administrator to the list (**D-7**). One line in 0027's `save()`. (b) No; add a "Guardar y añadir
variantes" secondary button. (c) No change.

**OQ-8 — A "replace this variant's combination" affordance?**
**(a) No in v1 — the note plus Delete _(recommended)_** (**D-11**). (b) Yes — and then it must be
**create-then-delete**, with copy for the partial-failure window.

**OQ-9 — The variant price input's shape must match 0027's exactly.** **Recommended:
`type="text" inputmode="decimal"` on both screens**, with the server rule as the only authority. The
sub-question worth answering once: does `priceRules()` accept `19,99`? Moot at `APP_LOCALE=en`; Epic 5
makes it real.

**OQ-10 — Two amendments to 0030's attribute-type screen, both found from this story's composition point
(see [D-16](#d-16--the-attribute-value-rename-edge-case-resolved)).**
- (a) **A rename warning.** **Recommended: a non-blocking inline notice** in 0030's value repeater when
  an in-use value's text is edited, stating how many variant SKUs will be rewritten. Alternative: a
  blocking confirmation listing the affected variants — justified only if the physical re-labelling cost
  is real. **Not recommended: no warning**, which presents a catalog-wide mutation as a text edit.
- (b) 🔴 **The missing collision-error rendering.** **D-4.6** aborts a rename whole on any resulting SKU
  collision, so `products.variants.derived_sku_taken` can surface on a taxonomy screen that has no SKUs
  on it — and 0030 has no key, no field and no copy for it. **Recommended: 0030 renders it against the
  offending value row, naming the conflicting record.** This is a gap, not a preference.

**OQ-11 — 0029's OQ-18 is attributed to the wrong story.** It says *"0031 owns the reorder control and
should warn on it"* about **attribute-type** reordering; 0030 owns that screen (**D-15**).
**Recommended: re-point OQ-18 at 0030.** 0031 can at most render an informational note.

> 🟣 **2026-08-19: sharper, not weaker.** OQ-6's resolution means this story ships **no reorder control
> at all** (**D-16a**), so OQ-18's premise — *"0031 owns the reorder control"* — is now false on both
> readings, not just on the attribute-type one. Re-pointing it at **0030** is the only correct
> disposition. 0029's amendment did not touch OQ-18.

🟣 **OQ-13 — What page size does the paginated variants list use?** *(new 2026-08-19, opened by
[D-17](#d-17--pagination-kept-from-the-old-d-174-because-it-is-not-generator-specific);
does **not** block Phase 3 — the mechanism is decided, only the constant is open)*
- **(a) 25, matching [0027](../done/0027-products-list-and-editor-ui.md) **D-4**'s `->paginate(25)` _(recommended)_.**
  Two differently-paginated lists on one product screen is the same class of inconsistency **OQ-9**
  refuses for the two money inputs, and 25 already survived review one story over.
- (b) A larger page (50) on the argument that a generated batch of 40 should be visible at once. Weigh
  it against the DOM weight this page already carries — four Gallery instances (**D-6**), a WYSIWYG and
  the region picker, plus a thumbnail, two badges and two actions per variant row (0031a's own R-11
  makes the generator-batch argument for this option in full).
- (c) A page size that varies with the generator's outcome (*"show all the rows I just created"*).
  **Not recommended** — a list whose page size changes under the administrator is worse than one that
  is occasionally short, and it makes every ordering assertion conditional.
- Note the coupling to 0029's **OQ-19**: if `MAX_COMBINATIONS` moves off 200, the worst-case number of
  pages a single gesture produces moves with it. The page size does not need to follow.

## Orchestration note — 2026-09-06

**Phase 2 gate cleared administratively before Phase 3 starts**, since this story's only two open
points are each a single named recommendation with a low, already-quantified cost of being wrong:

- **OQ-1 accepted as recommended**: all three variant operations (create/update/delete) authorize
  `update` on the parent `Product` via `ProductPolicy`, matching 0029 **D-12**'s shipped contract
  exactly (0029 already implemented it this way — this story's six `Gate::authorize('update', ...)`
  call sites in **D-10**/**D-13a** are therefore already correct, not merely recommended).
- **OQ-13 accepted as recommended**: the variants list paginates at **25**, matching 0027 **D-4**.

Neither reopens a design question — both were already the story's own stated default. Phase 2
(`code-reviewer` INVEST validation) proceeds against this resolved state.

## Provenance

Phase 1 (Three Amigos) debate for Epic 2, run on **2026-08-18** with `frontend-expert` (files and
approach) and `frontend-qa` (test design), per
[workflow.md](../../../docs/workflow.md#phase-1--three-amigos-debate). Derived from
[PRD §2.2](../../../docs/PRD/PRD.md#22-products)'s *"Product variants (extends the prototype)"* Gherkin block
and [§2.3](../../../docs/PRD/PRD.md#23-shared-media-gallery), and grounded in **full readings** of
[0029](../done/0029-product-variants-backend.md) (2,306 lines, read in full — it was substantially redesigned on
the same day) and [0027](../done/0027-products-list-and-editor-ui.md) (1,512 lines, read in full), plus
[0028](../done/0028-product-attribute-types-and-values-backend.md),
[0030](../done/0030-product-attribute-types-and-values-ui.md) and
[0020](../done/0020-shared-media-gallery-modal-ui.md) for their data and embedding contracts, and the whole of
[errors-log.md](../../../docs/errors-log.md).

**How the three roles were covered — stated plainly rather than implied.** Both specialists were
convened as subagents and **both delivered in full**, each executing its claims against this repository
rather than reasoning about them; neither wrote a file. `product-owner` read 0029, 0027, the PRD block,
`workflow.md`, `contracts.md`, the Gherkin guidelines and the errors log directly, then reconciled the
two contributions and independently re-verified **QA-V1**, **QA-V2**, **QA-V4** and **QA-V5** — the four
findings the test strategy turns on — before adopting them.

- **`frontend-expert`** is the source of **D-1**'s four-way comparison and its decisive error-bag
  argument, **D-2**'s repeater and keying rules, **D-3**'s costed generator analysis, **D-4**'s
  implementation, **D-6**'s corrected eager-load list, **D-7**, **D-11**, **D-12**, **D-13**, **D-14**'s
  fifteen-trap table, **D-15**, and findings **FE-V2**–**FE-V14**.
- **`frontend-qa`** is the source of the test plan's layer split, **D-5**'s three requirements and the
  stale-option-list divergence, **D-9**'s detector, the eighteen-item false-pass catalogue, the
  three-type ordering-fixture correction, and findings **QA-V1**–**QA-V10**.
- **`product-owner`** contributed **PO-V1**–**PO-V3**, resolved the **D-2** split, composed the Gherkin,
  and reconciled the two specialists' overlapping-but-different proposals for the combination control
  and for the dirty-parent-SKU case.

**Where the specialists split, and how it was resolved.** Exactly one substantive disagreement:
`frontend-expert` proposed an **add-a-row repeater** for the combination control, `frontend-qa` a **map
keyed by attribute type**. Both prevent 0029's **DIS-1** shape, which is the property that had to hold.
The repeater was chosen because the map renders one select pair per attribute type in the whole catalog
— unusable at 10¹–10² types — and because 0028/0030 already established the keyed-repeater pattern. **The
better half of the map proposal was adopted anyway**: **QA-V5**'s contract-derived
`[name="combinationRows.0.typeId"]` selector survives the change and is what **D-9**'s detector targets.
A second, smaller divergence — whether the builder should be disabled while the product's SKU field is
dirty (`frontend-qa`) or whether the child should not know about the parent's dirty state at all
(`frontend-expert`) — was resolved in favour of the latter, with the warning obligation moved onto 0027's
SKU field as **OQ-12**'s (a) option; the honest cost is recorded in **D-16(c)**.

**Three findings neither specialist was asked for and both would have been entitled to miss:**

1. **QA-V1/QA-V2 — a shipped test's stated rationale is false.** `tests/Browser/UsersIndexTest.php`
   claims to be the regression net for the 2026-08-16 null-`<select>` errors-log entry; Playwright's
   `selectOption` fires `change` unconditionally, so it cannot be. Carried as **R-3** and as a
   Definition-of-Done docs item rather than fixed here.
2. **The three-type ordering fixture.** 0029's own **FP16** demands three-way disagreement between
   position-, name- and id-order but illustrates it with **two** attribute types, which cannot produce
   it. A genuine correction to a dependency's test plan.
3. **D-5's stale-option-list divergence.** A preview built from a mount-time option list and a stored SKU
   derived from a database read-back can differ permanently, silently, with nothing wrong on either side
   — a UI-layer consequence of 0029's **V-10** that 0029 could not have seen, because it ships no
   component.

**The brief's hard question was answered rather than deferred.** [D-16](#d-16--the-attribute-value-rename-edge-case-resolved)
resolves what happens to a variant's SKU display when an attribute value in its combination is renamed:
0029's **OQ-13a** (re-derive) is endorsed with three concrete conditions, and the UI supplies an argument
0029 does not make — **the middle option (freeze on value rename, re-derive on parent-SKU change) is not
a cheap compromise but is unimplementable as specified**, because an honest preview would have to know
which of a variant's inputs had ever been renamed and nothing records that. What genuinely remains for a
human is recorded as **OQ-10**, not smuggled into a decision.

**Two of 0027's flagged bugs are noted but do not block this story.** 0027's **OQ-5** (0026's
`salesRegionIdRules()` re-validating every previously-assigned region, which would make a product with a
since-deactivated region unsaveable) and **OQ-6** (`SyncProductGallery`'s position-writing mechanism, and
the 0024/0026 disagreement about who calls it) are both about **product-level** sales-region and gallery
sync. Nothing in this story touches either path: the builder writes only `product_variants` and its
pivot, through 0029's own actions. They are recorded here as **known surrounding-system issues being
fixed in parallel**, not as this story's defects — but note the second-order effect: while 0027's OQ-5 is
open, a product carrying a deactivated region cannot be saved at all, which means its **editor page** —
and therefore this builder — is reachable but its parent form is not saveable. That does not break the
builder (variants save independently, **D-7**), and it is worth knowing before someone reports it as a
variant bug.

### 🟣 Amendment — 2026-08-19

**Not a new Three Amigos round.** This amendment is this story binding to
[0029's own amendment](../done/0029-product-variants-backend.md#amendment--2026-08-19-four-contract-gap-fills-and-the-cartesian-generator)
of the same day, plus one PO scope decision. `product-owner` read 0029's D-15 through D-18 in full and
verified each claim against the amended document rather than against the summary of it; no subagent was
convened, because nothing here required a specialist judgement that was not already made in 0029.

**What changed in this document:**

- The [Description](#description) (four actions, eleven deliverables) and [Type](#type) (the
  classification restated point by point, and why 0029's `includes database-expert: yes` does not
  propagate).
- A new Gherkin feature — *Generating every combination at once*, **twelve** scenarios — plus a note in
  [PRD coverage](#prd-coverage) recording that the generator is PO-added scope, not PRD-derived.
- A dated amendment block at the head of [Documented functional decisions](#documented-functional-decisions).
- **D-3 superseded** (struck at the head, kept whole, with a point-by-point table of what each of its
  four arguments became) and replaced by **D-17** — the generator UI, in five subsections: the trigger
  and modal container, the axis picker, the confirmed action surface, the result summary, the
  pagination consequence, and OQ-6's resolution.
- **D-6**, **D-8**, **D-13** and **D-15** bound to 0029's now-published contract: the named relations,
  the six-key error table (grown to seven rows here, of which **five** render nowhere unless rendered
  explicitly — up from three), the seven-method trait, and the generator's translation keys with the
  two-owner split rule.
- Scope fences: the cartesian fence **struck and replaced** with the narrower set 0029 **D-18.7**
  leaves standing; the reorder fence tightened from *"unless OQ-6 says otherwise"* to a resolved *"none,
  and do not fake one"*.
- One new test file (`VariantBuilderGeneratorTest.php`, fifteen cases), two new browser cases
  (**B9**, **B10**), a pagination case in the query file, four new false passes
  (**FP-V19**–**FP-V22**), six new acceptance criteria, and two Definition-of-Done bullets.
- Risks: **R-5** and **R-6** closed with their resolutions recorded; **R-11** and **R-12** added.
- Open questions: **OQ-2**, **OQ-3** and **OQ-6** resolved; **OQ-5** narrowed; **OQ-11** sharpened;
  **OQ-13** (page size) added. **OQ-1 is now the only blocker.**

**Three judgements this amendment made that 0029 did not hand down**, each argued in place rather than
assumed: the generator's container is a **modal** (safe here precisely because it opens no Gallery, so
**D-12**'s nested-`<dialog>` rule is applied rather than broken); the result is an **inline summary
panel**, not a flash (a flash structurally cannot carry a per-row `refused` list) and not the modal (it
would cover the table it just changed); and the axis picker's property is named **`attributeTypeIds`**
so that it collides *deliberately* with 0029's bag key and auto-renders — the one place on this screen
where **FE-V4** works in our favour.

🟠 **Phase 2 HAS now run — and this story FAILED it (2026-09-06).** The paragraph that stood here read
*"**Not yet run:** Phase 2 (`code-reviewer` INVEST validation). Four items deserve an explicit look.
🟣 **Size — and it grew on 2026-08-19, which is the item Phase 2 should weigh first.** This story
carries a nested component, a live-derived read-only display, a keyed repeater, a fourth gallery
instance, an authorization surface of **seven** methods, and now a generator with its own modal, axis
picker, live count, summary panel and paginator. Two cut lines are available and they are not equally
good: the **image** half (**D-6**) is independently valuable and independently testable and was the
original recommendation; the **generator** half (**D-17**) is a cleaner cut *technically* — it touches
one new action, one new modal and one new test file, and the single-variant builder is complete
without it — but it depends on the builder existing, so it can only be a *follow-on*, never a parallel
split. …And **the amendment load**: this story raised six amendments across three other stories (0027,
0029, 0030) — two of them (OQ-3, OQ-6) are now discharged, leaving four (**OQ-5** on 0029, **OQ-7** and
**OQ-12** on 0027, **OQ-10** on 0030), all still in the `new` stage — cheap today, expensive once any of
them enters Phase 3."* — and it named the outcome almost exactly. Phase 2 ran and the verdict is in:

| Item this section flagged | Phase 2 verdict |
| --- | --- |
| **Size, and the *generator* cut line named here as "cleaner cut technically... but can only be a follow-on, never a parallel split"** | **FAIL on INVEST "Small".** `code-reviewer` bundled two conceptually separable units — the single-variant builder (D-1–D-16, ~28 scenarios, 6 test files) and the generator UI (the old D-17 and its five subsections, its own test file, 2 browser cases, 4 false passes, a 12-scenario Gherkin feature) — the same shape that made **0029 itself** fail "Small" and split into 0029/0029a/0029b, whose generator half (0029b) is the exact feature the old D-17 rendered a UI for. Resolved exactly the way this paragraph already predicted it would have to be: the generator half split out, as a **follow-on** story sequenced immediately after this one — **[0031a](0031a-product-variant-generator-ui.md)** — never a parallel split |
| **OQ-2 not changing the classification** | **Confirmed, unaffected by the split.** [Type](#type) never depended on the generator being in this file; it says so explicitly both before and after |
| **R-1's argued-not-rendered IA, doubled for the generator** | **Unaffected by the split as a finding** — it was never a blocker, only a note that Phase 2 should treat every IA choice here as a decision to confirm. The generator's own version of this note is now 0031a's |
| **The amendment load (six amendments raised on three other stories)** | **Unaffected by the split** — none of OQ-5/OQ-7/OQ-10/OQ-12 was about the generator, so none needed re-routing; they remain this story's own open hand-offs, carried in the [Definition of Done](#definition-of-done) unchanged |

**What moved, in one place**: the old D-17 and subsections D-17.1–D-17.4 in full, the generator-specific
tail of D-17.5, the "Generating every combination at once" Gherkin feature (12 scenarios),
`tests/Feature/Products/VariantBuilderGeneratorTest.php`, browser cases B9/B10, four false passes
(FP-V19–FP-V22), two risks (R-11/R-12), five generator-specific acceptance-criteria bullets and two
Definition-of-Done bullets. **What stayed, trimmed of its generator framing**: the old D-17.4's
pagination decision (renumbered **D-17**, this file's own now) and the old D-17.5's "Half 2" row-order
reasoning (renumbered **D-16a**) — neither was ever generator-specific. **D-10** was also corrected in
the same pass: it still read *"this story is 0029's only enforcement path"*, contradicted by this file's
own 2026-09-04 amendment note (point 2), which already recorded that 0029's D-12.1 makes the variant
actions self-authorizing. **D-3** is restored as this story's live scope fence, superseded a second time
rather than a first, with both supersessions recorded in place.
