# Derived columns: every invariant must hold at every write site

Established by story **0029**'s Phase 4 audit (product variants — the derived `product_variants.sku`).
This is the first page here about a **stored derived column** — a value the application computes from
other rows and then persists, rather than one a user supplies.

## The rule

**Every invariant a derived column's *creating* writer enforces must be re-enforced at every
*re-derivation* writer, or the invariant is a property of one code path rather than of the column.**

A derived value has more write sites than an ordinary one, and they are easy to miss because they do
not look like writes to that column at all — they look like edits to the column's *inputs*. In story
0029 there are three writers of `product_variants.sku`:

| Writer | Looks like | Enforces the length cap? | Enforces the empty-segment rule? | Catches `1062`? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `CreateProductVariant` | creating a variant | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (and disambiguates *which* unique index) |
| `UpdateProduct::reDeriveVariantSkus()` | renaming a **product** | ❌ | ❌ (n/a — values unchanged) | ⚠️ caught, but attributed to the product's own `sku` |
| `SyncProductAttributeValues::reDeriveVariantSkusForRenamedValues()` | renaming an **attribute value** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

Only the first row *reads* as a SKU writer. The other two are the whole point: an administrator
renaming a colour on a taxonomy screen is, transitively, the author of a new value in a `UNIQUE`,
length-capped column on a different table.

## Why a derived column concentrates this failure

The creating writer is where the invariants get written, because it is where the design conversation
happens — it is the class the story is named after, the one with the docblock, the one every test
targets. The re-derivation sites are added later in the same story as *retrofits to other stories'
files*, under a different heading ("the cascade"), and they are reviewed against the question **"does
the SKU follow its inputs?"** rather than **"is this a legal SKU?"**.

Both cascades here answer the first question correctly and neither asks the second.

## ❌ The three guards that exist on one write site and not the others

`CreateProductVariant` gets it right, and is the reference:

```php
// app/Actions/Products/CreateProductVariant.php — the creating writer
foreach ($ordered as $value) {
    if ($deriveVariantSku->segment($value->value) === '') {
        throw ValidationException::withMessages([
            'sku' => trans('products.variants.derived_sku_empty_segment', ['value' => $value->value]),
        ]);
    }
}

$sku = $deriveVariantSku($product->sku, $orderedValues);

if (mb_strlen($sku) > DeriveVariantSku::MAX_LENGTH) {
    throw ValidationException::withMessages([
        'sku' => trans('products.variants.derived_sku_too_long', ['max' => DeriveVariantSku::MAX_LENGTH]),
    ]);
}
```

Neither cascade carries either guard. The re-derivation loop is only:

```php
// app/Actions/Products/SyncProductAttributeValues.php — the value-rename cascade (❌ as shipped)
foreach ($variants as $variant) {
    $orderedValues = $variant->values->pluck('value')->all();
    $newSkus[$variant->id] = $deriveVariantSku($variant->product->sku, $orderedValues);
}

// ...a cross-table conflict pre-check per new SKU, then:

foreach ($newSkus as $variantId => $newSku) {
    DB::table('product_variants')->where('id', $variantId)->update([
        'sku' => $newSku,
        'updated_at' => now(),
    ]);
}
```

Three reproduced consequences, all with `sql_mode` including `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` (**V-A**):

- **The length cap is enforced by MySQL instead of by the application.** `product_attribute_values.value`
  is `max:100` and a combination holds up to ten of them, against a `varchar(128)` `sku` — so renaming
  one value to a long string is enough. Reproduced: `SQLSTATE[22001] … 1406 Data too long for column
  'sku'`, an unhandled `QueryException` reaching the caller, on both cascades. This is precisely the
  outcome the story's own test checklist forbids (*"refused cleanly, not truncated and not a raw
  `1406`/`22001`"*) — that checklist item exists, and is satisfied only on the creating path.
- **The empty-segment rule is not enforced at all on the rename path.** Reproduced: renaming a value to
  `'???'` (which `segment()` reduces to `''`) raises **no exception** and stores the SKU `AA-`. The
  D-4.4 invariant that a value reducing to the empty string is *refused loudly* holds only at creation.
- **The pre-check compares each new SKU against the rows' *pre-rename* values**, so two variants whose
  renamed segments collide with each other both pass the check and the second `update()` hits the
  unique index. Reproduced: an uncaught `UniqueConstraintViolationException` (`1062 … for key
  'product_variants.product_variants_sku_unique'`). The transaction does roll back cleanly — atomicity
  is not the defect — but the administrator gets a 500 rather than the `derived_sku_taken` message that
  exists for exactly this case.

The severity is error-handling and data integrity rather than access control: no guard is *bypassed*,
and the enclosing transaction rolls back in every reproduced case. What escapes is a raw
`QueryException`, whose message carries the SQL statement plus the connection's host, port and database
name into the log and — at `APP_DEBUG=true` — onto the page.

## ✅ What closes it

**Move the invariant into the derivation's own seam, so no writer can call it and skip the check.**
Three writers each remembering three rules is the shape that produced this; the guards belong beside
`DeriveVariantSku`, which is already the single definition every writer shares:

```php
// app/Actions/Products/DeriveVariantSku.php — SHIPPED (2026-09-04). One checked entry
// point, called by all three writers; `__invoke()` remains for the pure derivation.
class DeriveVariantSku
{
    public const MAX_LENGTH = 128;

    /** @throws ValidationException */
    public function checked(string $productSku, array $orderedValues): string
    {
        foreach ($orderedValues as $value) {
            if ($this->segment($value) === '') {
                throw ValidationException::withMessages([
                    'sku' => trans('products.variants.derived_sku_empty_segment', ['value' => $value]),
                ]);
            }
        }

        $sku = $this($productSku, $orderedValues);

        if (mb_strlen($sku) > self::MAX_LENGTH) {
            throw ValidationException::withMessages([
                'sku' => trans('products.variants.derived_sku_too_long', ['max' => self::MAX_LENGTH]),
            ]);
        }

        return $sku;
    }
}
```

Two further rules the cascades need on top of it:

- **A batch pre-check must compare against the batch's own pending values, not only against the
  database.** Collect every new value first, assert the batch is internally unique, *then* check it
  against the rows that are not being rewritten. The existing `->where('id', '!=', $variantId)`
  exclusion is what makes the database half correct and is also what makes the batch half invisible.
- **A re-derivation site needs the same last-word `1062` catch its creating sibling has** — including
  `CreateProductVariant::translateRaceViolation()`'s disambiguation between the two unique indexes on
  `product_variants` (`product_variants_sku_unique` vs.
  `product_variants_product_id_combination_hash_unique`; both names verified against
  `php artisan db:table product_variants`). `UpdateProduct` has a `1062` catch but attributes every one
  of them to the *product's* own `sku`, which is now wrong for the variant rows its own cascade writes.

## The review question

> **Who else can change this column's inputs, and does that path enforce everything the column's own
> writer does?**

Ask it of every stored derived value. The answer is never "just the class the story is named after" —
the inputs are on other tables, edited from other screens, by other stories' shipped actions. The
same question applied to a *hash* rather than a SKU is what
[database/schema.md](../database/schema-products.md#product_attribute_values) already records as story 0029's
dependency on 0028's id-stability guarantee: a derived column's correctness is a property of the whole
set of paths that can move its inputs.

## Related: re-loading a relation does not re-read the key it resolves through

A second, smaller finding from the same audit, recorded here because it is the derived-value idea
applied to an **authorization target**. `UpdateProductVariant` and `DeleteProductVariant` authorize
against the variant's parent product, and correctly reload the relation first, per
[model-instance-trust.md](model-instance-trust.md):

```php
// app/Actions/Products/DeleteProductVariant.php (❌ as shipped)
$variant->load('product');

$this->logRefusedPrivilegedAttempt->authorize(
    'update',
    $variant->product,
    targetType: 'product',
    targetId: $variant->product->id,
);

return (bool) $variant->delete();
```

`load('product')` re-reads the **product**, but it resolves *which* product from the caller's
in-memory `$variant->product_id` — which is mass-assignable on `ProductVariant`
(`#[Fillable(['product_id', …])]`) and is simply a public attribute besides. `delete()` then acts on
`$variant->getKey()`. So the row acted on and the row authorized against come from two different
sources, and a caller that stages the instance decides which product the gate sees. Reproduced: a
variant belonging to product `VICTIM` was deleted while the gate evaluated `update` against product
`DECOY`.

**No shipped caller does this** — story 0029 ships no Livewire component or route at all, and story
0031's editor will resolve variants with `findOrFail()`. It is a latent shape, not a live bypass. The
rule it illustrates is worth keeping regardless:

> **Re-read the *subject* of the operation, not only the relation you authorize through.** A relation
> refreshed from an in-memory foreign key is exactly as trustworthy as that foreign key.

The concrete fix is one line — resolve the variant from the database inside the action
(`$variant = ProductVariant::query()->with('product')->findOrFail($variant->getKey())`) and act only
through that instance, the same "re-fetch the row and read/write only through that instance" remedy
[model-instance-trust.md](model-instance-trust.md) already prescribes for `SalesRegion`. Removing
`product_id` from `ProductVariant`'s `#[Fillable]` is worth doing beside it (a variant's parent is
fixed at creation and `CreateProductVariant` writes it through `forceCreate()` anyway), but it is
defence in depth, not the fix — `save()` writes the whole dirty set, so the omission is a
mass-assignment guard and not an integrity one.

> ✅ **Both shipped, and the ordering is the part to preserve.** `UpdateProductVariant` and
> `DeleteProductVariant` open with
> `ProductVariant::query()->with('product')->whereKey($variant->getKey())->firstOrFail()`, and that

## What the remediation introduced: a retried transaction is a retry-safe unit, or it is a lost update

❌ **As found (first re-audit, 2026-09-04) — ✅ closed the same day by the second re-audit; see the
block at the end of this section.** Found by re-auditing the fix as new code, per
[errors-log-archive.md](../errors-log-archive.md#two-of-the-three-security-audit-rounds-found-the-flaw-in-the-previous-rounds-fix--2026-08-19).
The ❌ text below is kept verbatim as the record of what shipped, per the audit-authored-page rule.

The same remediation added `attempts: 3` to three `DB::transaction()` calls, so that the fixed lock
order those transactions rely on converges under a deadlock instead of 500-ing. `attempts: N` changes
one thing about a closure that is easy to miss: **the closure can now run more than once, and a
rollback restores the database but not the PHP objects the closure mutated.**

```php
// app/Actions/Products/UpdateProduct.php — ❌ as shipped: $product is created OUTSIDE the closure
return DB::transaction(function () use ($product, $sku, /* … */): Product {
    $skuChanged = $product->sku !== $sku;

    $product->update(['sku' => $sku, /* … */]);   // attempt 1: syncOriginal() runs

    if ($skuChanged) {
        $this->reDeriveVariantSkus($product, $sku);   // ← a plausible deadlock site
    }

    return $product;
}, attempts: 3);
```

Executed rather than reasoned about — the Eloquent half, with no database involved:

| | attempt 1 | attempt 2 (after the rollback) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$product->sku !== $sku` | `true` | **`false`** |
| `isDirty()` after `fill()`, i.e. does `update()` issue SQL | `true` | **`false`** |

So a concurrency error anywhere in that closure — a genuine 1213, or the far likelier
`Lock wait timeout exceeded`, both of which `causedByConcurrencyError()` matches — makes attempt 2
**commit having written nothing**: the product's own column changes were rolled back and are never
re-applied, `$skuChanged` is now false so the variant cascade is skipped entirely, and the action
returns a `Product` whose in-memory attributes show the new values, so the caller reports success. A
silent lost update, reported as saved. `SyncProductGallery` shares the shape (`forceFill(...)->save()`
on the same outside-the-closure instance), so the featured-image write is lost with it.

✅ **The pattern this repo already had, one folder away** — pass **keys** into the closure and re-read
the rows inside it, so every attempt starts from the database:

```php
// app/Actions/SalesRegions/SetSalesRegionActive.php — the shape to copy
$regionKey = $region->getKey();
$replacementKey = $replacementDefault?->getKey();

return DB::transaction(function () use ($regionKey, $replacementKey, $active): SalesRegion {
    $rows = SalesRegion::query()->whereIn('id', [$regionKey, $replacementKey])
        ->orderBy('id')->lockForUpdate()->get()->keyBy(fn ($r) => $r->getKey());
    // …every model this closure writes was fetched by THIS attempt.
}, attempts: 3);
```

**The rule: adding `attempts: N` is a change to the closure's contract, not a flag.** Before adding it,
check that every model, collection or accumulator the closure writes to was created *inside* it — an
Eloquent model created outside is the common case, and it fails silently rather than loudly, because
`save()` on a non-dirty model is a successful no-op rather than an error.

⚠️ **A second, coupled fact: `attempts` on a nested transaction is inert, and all three of this
story's are nested on the only shipped path.** `Connection::handleTransactionException()` refuses to
retry while `$this->transactions > 1` — it converts the error to a `DeadlockException` and rethrows,
so only the **outermost** transaction's `attempts` ever fires. `App\Livewire\Products\Editor::save()`
opens its own `DB::transaction()` around `CreateProduct`/`UpdateProduct`, and that outer one takes no
`attempts` — so the retry never runs there, and the window the fix was aimed at is still open on the
screen that matters. **Do not close that half first.** Moving `attempts: 3` up to `Editor::save()`
without fixing the shape above converts a rare, loud 500 into a silent lost update on every retry.
`SetSalesRegionActive`'s own docblock already records the outermost-transaction rule; it is restated
here because this story is where the two halves first pull against each other.

> ✅ **Closed 2026-09-04 (second re-audit, finding R-1) — by removal, not by rewriting the closure.**

introduced](#what-the-remediation-introduced-a-retried-transaction-is-a-retry-safe-unit-or-it-is-a-lost-update)
section above states — and the R-1 closure block repeats — that `App\Livewire\Products\Editor::save()`
is *"the only shipped caller"* opening an outer `DB::transaction()` around these actions, and that
*"`Editor::save()`'s outer transaction makes both retained `attempts: 3` inert on the shipped path."*
Read together, both sentences imply `Editor::save()` is this domain's **only** outer transaction. That
stopped being true the moment `App\Actions\Products\GenerateProductVariantCombinations` shipped: it
opens its **own** outer `DB::transaction(attempts: 3)`, entirely independent of `Editor::save()`,
wrapping a loop of `CreateProductVariant` calls whose own `DB::transaction(attempts: 3)` becomes a
savepoint under it — the identical nesting shape `Editor::save()` already produces over
`CreateProduct`/`UpdateProduct`. Both sentences are kept above as the record of what this page
asserted, per this project's audit-authored-page convention, rather than silently rewritten.

Two things follow, and neither is a new *mechanism* — both are the already-documented
nested-`attempts`-is-inert rule confirmed on a second, independent call path, which is why this fact
belongs on this page rather than in [errors-log.md](../errors-log.md) (whose own 2026-08-19 entry
records the rule that a repeated instance of an already-documented mistake stays off the log and on the
relevant page instead):

1. **The generator's own transaction is retry-safe by the rule this page already states above.** Every
   mutable accumulator it writes — the `created`/`skipped`/`refused` summary, the pre-read
   `combination_hash` set, the per-combination loop state — is created **fresh inside the closure** on
   every attempt. Unlike the `UpdateProduct` hazard documented above, there is no Eloquent model
   mutated *outside* the closure for a retry to silently no-op against.
2. **`CreateProductVariant`'s own `attempts: 3` is silently inert when invoked from inside the
   generator's transaction**, for the identical reason it is already inert when `CreateProduct`/
   `UpdateProduct` run inside `Editor::save()`'s: `Illuminate\Database\Concerns\ManagesTransactions
   ::transaction()` only enters its retry loop when `$this->transactions === 1` on the connection — at
   any deeper nesting level, `handleTransactionException()` converts a concurrency exception straight
   to a rethrow, never retrying. Verified against the trait itself rather than assumed from the
   `Editor::save()` case alone.

**The general rule this page now states outright, generalized past both instances**: `DB::transaction($fn,
attempts: N)`'s retry only ever fires for the **outermost** transaction on the connection — a callee's
own `attempts` value is inert the moment *anything* wraps it, regardless of which class opened the
outer transaction, how many call frames sit in between, or whether the outer transaction itself
requested a retry.

⚠️ **For a future caller.** Before adding `attempts: N` to any `DB::transaction()` in this domain,
first determine whether it can ever run nested under another one already carrying `attempts` (or ever
will) — an inert `attempts` is not itself a bug, but a `DB::transaction()` that *assumes* its own retry
will fire when an enclosing one already suppresses it is the same lost-update shape documented above,
arriving through nesting rather than through a badly-scoped closure. **Story 0031's future integration
of the generator into `Editor::save()` must not add its own `attempts:` to that outer transaction
without first re-deriving this analysis** — see the epic-2 decision digest's Story 0029b entry.

## Confirmed safe: `causedByConcurrencyError()` matches a message, not a class

Worth recording because the obvious mental model is wrong and the safety here is contingent rather
than structural. `Illuminate\Database\ConcurrencyErrorDetector::causedByConcurrencyError()` does **not**
test that the exception is a `QueryException`. It tests `$e instanceof PDOException` with SQLSTATE
`40001`, and otherwise falls through to `Str::contains($e->getMessage(), [...])` against ten literal
strings, **for any `Throwable`**. Verified by execution:

```php
$d = new Illuminate\Database\ConcurrencyErrorDetector();
$d->causedByConcurrencyError(ValidationException::withMessages(
    ['sku' => 'Deadlock found when trying to get lock']));   // true
$d->causedByConcurrencyError(ValidationException::withMessages(
    ['sku' => 'The derived SKU AA-X is already in use.']));   // false
```

`ValidationException`'s own message is `static::summarize($validator)` — **the first validation error
message**, interpolations included. So a `ValidationException` thrown inside a retried transaction is
retried whenever its rendered message happens to contain one of those literals, and every one of them
contains spaces.

This is inert here, and each step of that was checked rather than assumed. Only five messages can be
thrown inside these transactions (`duplicate_combination`, `derived_sku_taken`,
`derived_sku_empty_segment`, `derived_sku_too_long`, `parent_sku_change_collides`, plus
`validation.unique`/`validation.exists`), and only two interpolate anything: `:sku`, which
`DeriveVariantSku::segment()` restricts to `[A-Za-z0-9._/-]` and therefore cannot contain a space; and
`:value`, the raw attribute value — which reaches that message **only** when `segment($value) === ''`,
i.e. only when the value contains no letters or digits at all, so it cannot spell any of the literals
either. **The rule for the next story: a transaction with `attempts: N` must not throw an exception
whose message can carry user-controlled text**, or an ordinary validation refusal silently becomes
three times the work — and, with a mutating closure like the one above, three times the damage.

_Last updated: 2026-09-05 — Story 0029b (Product variant combination generator — backend). **Corrected
this page's own stale claim, in place, per the audit-authored-page convention**: the
[What the remediation introduced](#what-the-remediation-introduced-a-retried-transaction-is-a-retry-safe-unit-or-it-is-a-lost-update)
section's "`Editor::save()`, the only shipped caller" framing implied `Editor::save()` was this
domain's *only* outer transaction — false as of this story, which ships
`App\Actions\Products\GenerateProductVariantCombinations` as a second, independent outer
`DB::transaction(attempts: 3)`, with `CreateProductVariant`'s own transaction nesting under it as a
savepoint exactly as it already does under `Editor::save()`. Added
[Second confirming instance: a generator's own outer transaction — `attempts` fires only at nesting level 1](#second-confirming-instance-a-generators-own-outer-transaction--attempts-fires-only-at-nesting-level-1),
generalizing the mechanism this page already carried (verified against
`Illuminate\Database\Concerns\ManagesTransactions`: the retry loop only fires when
`$this->transactions === 1`) into a rule this domain's next transaction author must check before
adding `attempts:` to anything — explicitly including story 0031's future `Editor::save()` integration
of this generator. Deliberately **not** a new `errors-log.md` entry, per this project's own precedent
(a repeated instance of an already-documented mistake stays on the relevant page, not the log) and per
this story's own scope fence against duplicating findings already closed by story 0029. **Verified as
unchanged rather than assumed:** every other section on this page — the derived-`sku`/`combination_hash`
sections, the relation-reload finding and the `causedByConcurrencyError()` confirmed-safe note are all
untouched by this story's diff._

_Previously: 2026-09-04 (second re-audit, same day) — **this page's own remaining ❌ is now ✅**, and
the correction is the entry: the status banner and the
[What the remediation introduced](#what-the-remediation-introduced-a-retried-transaction-is-a-retry-safe-unit-or-it-is-a-lost-update)
section both still said ❌ OPEN after `UpdateProduct` had already dropped its `attempts: 3`, which is
[the audit-authored-page failure mode](../errors-log-archive.md#a-security-page-documented-the-vulnerable-code-as-current-because-it-was-written-before-its-own-fix--2026-08-20)
recurring on the page that cites it. Closed here with the ❌ text kept verbatim: **R-1** (closed by
removal — no `attempts` on `UpdateProduct`'s transaction, none reintroduced by `Editor::save()`, both
retained `attempts: 3` re-verified retry-safe, pinned by a source assertion that proves it can fail),
**R-3** (`UpdateProduct` now calls the shared `TranslateProductVariantUniqueViolation` with an
`?string $overrideMessage`; re-checked that the override is a `trans()` key from the call site and
opens no path for an index name or SQL to reach an actor-facing message), and **R-4** (both cascades
exclude `array_keys($newSkus)`, with the internal-duplicate check confirmed to still run **first**, the
gap-lock and fixed-lock-order arguments confirmed unaffected by the added `whereNotIn`, and one honest
narrowing recorded: a true two-element swap still cannot succeed through sequential updates against an
immediately-enforced `UNIQUE` index — it now fails at the write, cleanly and fully rolled back, rather
than at the pre-check)._

_Previously: 2026-09-04 (re-audit, same day) — both original sections closed by the story's own
remediation and re-verified here by execution, per the audit-authored-page rule. Added
[What the remediation introduced](#what-the-remediation-introduced-a-retried-transaction-is-a-retry-safe-unit-or-it-is-a-lost-update)
(❌ OPEN: `attempts: 3` over a closure that mutates an Eloquent model created outside it, with the
`SetSalesRegionActive` key-passing shape as the ✅, plus the coupled fact that `attempts` on a nested
transaction is inert and `Products\Editor::save()` is where the outermost one lives) and
[Confirmed safe: `causedByConcurrencyError()` matches a message, not a class](#confirmed-safe-causedbyconcurrencyerror-matches-a-message-not-a-class).
Two ⚠️ notes added inside the existing sections: the two cascades' per-row pre-check excludes only its
own row rather than the whole batch (a fail-closed false refusal on a two-variant SKU rotation), and
`UpdateProduct`'s outer `1062` catch re-implements the two-index disambiguation inline instead of using
the extracted translator._

_Previously: 2026-09-04 — created by story 0029's Phase 4 audit (product variants — core backend).
Both sections ❌ OPEN. Every reproduction was executed against this worktree (MySQL 8.4,
`STRICT_TRANS_TABLES`, `REPEATABLE-READ`) using temporary test files that were removed afterwards._
