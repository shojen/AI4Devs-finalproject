# Contracts — Full test suite gate and parallel agent file ownership

> Part of [Contracts](../contracts.md). **Read this part when:** you are about to close a task (move it to `done/`) or dispatch two or more agents in the same batch. The other parts are listed in the [hub](../contracts.md#rules).

### Full Test Suite Gate Rule

A task must **never be closed** — i.e. its file must never be moved from `ai-spec/tasks/in-progress/` to `ai-spec/tasks/done/` (Phase 7 of [workflow.md](../workflow.md)), and work must never proceed to the next task — while even one test in the **full** suite is failing. "All tests green" means every test in the project, not just the tests the current task added or touched.

Follow this protocol:

1. **Immediately before moving a task's file to `done/`, run the complete suite** (`php artisan test`, not a filtered subset) and confirm it reports 100% passing.
2. **A failing test blocks closure regardless of whose it is.** A failure that predates the current task, belongs to unrelated code, or was only just discovered is not an exception — "not my test" does not authorize closing the task anyway. Diagnose and resolve it first, following [workflow.md](../workflow.md) Phase 3's existing "Test issue" vs. "Code issue" distinction for how to fix it and who fixes it.
3. **A suspicious mass-failure must be verified as real before being acted on or reported as a regression.** If a full-suite run shows unexpected, widespread failures, first rule out test-run interference — most commonly two processes (e.g. two agents, or a manual run overlapping an agent's run) exercising the same shared database concurrently, which can produce deadlocks or seed collisions that look like a regression but are not one. Re-run the suite in isolation, with no other process touching the same database, before drawing any conclusion.
4. **Only a single, isolated, 100%-passing full-suite run is sufficient evidence to close a task.** A task file's Definition of Done "full suite green" checkbox must not be checked off, and the file must not be moved to `done/`, on the strength of anything weaker than that — not a partial/filtered run, not a run contaminated by concurrent interference, and not a prior run whose result may since have been invalidated by later changes.

This complements [workflow.md](../workflow.md)'s existing gates — Phase 3's TDD requirement that tests are green before Phase 4, and Phase 5's "the full test suite passes" review criterion — by making the same requirement binding specifically at the Phase 7 closure step, so a regression introduced or discovered between Phase 5's review and closure cannot slip a task into `done/` unnoticed.

### Parallel Agent File-Ownership Rule

Never dispatch two or more agents **in parallel** — concurrently, in the same tool-call batch — when their scopes can write to the same file. "Can write to" is broader than "is about": it includes any file an agent's **verification or regression-proof step** might touch, even transiently, even if that file is not its stated primary target.

Follow this protocol:

1. **Before dispatching a batch, enumerate each agent's full write set**, not just the file its task is named after. A test-fixing agent that proves an assertion can genuinely fail by temporarily editing application code writes to that application file; a docs agent asked to verify a snippet against the code may not. Judge by the *method* each agent will use, not by the task's title.
2. **If two agents' write sets intersect at all, do not run them in parallel.** Choose one of two options: run them **sequentially** (the first completes and reports before the second is dispatched), or **state the ownership boundary explicitly in both agents' instructions** — naming which agent may write the shared file and requiring the other to treat it as read-only.
3. **A transient edit counts as a write.** Reverting it afterwards does not make it safe: while it is in place, a concurrent agent can read it, and the last writer wins if both edits are real.
4. **Treat an unexplained edit as blocking, not as noise.** An agent that observes a change it did not make must stop and report rather than proceed or work around it — that is the correct response even when the cause turns out to be benign concurrency, because the same symptom is what a genuine injected instruction or a lost-edit bug looks like.
5. **Do not accept a verification run that overlapped a concurrent agent's edits.** Re-run it in isolation, consistent with the Full Test Suite Gate Rule above, which already refuses contaminated evidence.

This rule exists because of a real incident during story 0006's Phase 5 re-fix round: two subagents scoped to "different files" both ended up writing to `resources/views/livewire/users.blade.php`, one persistently and one transiently as part of a legitimate regression-proof, and the resulting intermediate diff was briefly suspected of being adversarial.
