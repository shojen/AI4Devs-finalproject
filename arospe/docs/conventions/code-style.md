# Code Style

Real conventions observed and enforced in this codebase, each with a genuine example. Formatting itself (spacing, import order) is enforced mechanically by Pint (`pint.json` — Laravel preset) and doesn't need manual attention; run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` after any PHP change. Static analysis runs at Larastan level 7 (`phpstan.neon`).

## Explicit types everywhere

✅ Good — every method declares parameter and return types, including array shapes in the docblock when the type alone isn't expressive enough:

```php
// app/Actions/Fortify/CreateNewUser.php
/**
 * Validate and create a newly registered user.
 *
 * @param  array<string, string>  $input
 */
public function create(array $input): User
{
    Validator::make($input, [
        ...$this->profileRules(),
        'password' => $this->passwordRules(),
    ])->validate();

    return User::create([
        'name' => $input['name'],
        'email' => $input['email'],
        'password' => $input['password'],
    ]);
}
```

❌ Bad — the same method without types (adapted to illustrate the violation; this is not real code in the repo):

```php
// anti-pattern — do not write this
public function create($input)
{
    // ...
    return User::create([...]);
}
```
Without `array $input` and `: User`, Larastan (level 7) cannot verify the return value and IDEs lose autocomplete on the caller side.

## Always use curly braces

✅ Good — every conditional in the codebase, even trivial ones, uses braces:

```php
// app/Livewire/Settings/Security.php
public function mount(DisableTwoFactorAuthentication $disableTwoFactorAuthentication): void
{
    $this->canManageTwoFactor = Features::canManageTwoFactorAuthentication();

    if ($this->canManageTwoFactor) {
        if (Fortify::confirmsTwoFactorAuthentication() && is_null(auth()->user()->two_factor_confirmed_at)) {
            $disableTwoFactorAuthentication(auth()->user());
        }
        // ...
    }
}
```

❌ Bad — brace-less single-line form (adapted to illustrate; not present in the repo):

```php
// anti-pattern — do not write this
if ($this->canManageTwoFactor)
    $this->twoFactorEnabled = auth()->user()->hasEnabledTwoFactorAuthentication();
```
Brace-less bodies are easy to break silently when a second statement is added later.

## Centralize shared validation in traits

✅ Good — password and profile rules live in one trait each and are reused everywhere they're needed, instead of being rewritten per call site:

```php
// app/Concerns/PasswordValidationRules.php
trait PasswordValidationRules
{
    protected function passwordRules(): array
    {
        return ['required', 'string', Password::default(), 'confirmed'];
    }

    protected function currentPasswordRules(): array
    {
        return ['required', 'string', 'current_password'];
    }
}
```

Consumed identically by `App\Actions\Fortify\CreateNewUser`, `App\Actions\Fortify\ResetUserPassword`, `App\Livewire\Settings\Security`, and `App\Livewire\Settings\DeleteUserForm` — four call sites, one definition.

❌ Bad — inlining the same rule array at each call site (adapted to illustrate; the trait exists specifically to prevent this):

```php
// anti-pattern — do not duplicate rules like this in a new component
$this->validate([
    'password' => ['required', 'string', Password::default(), 'confirmed'],
]);
```
If the password policy changes, a duplicated rule array means updating N call sites instead of one trait method — and it's easy to miss one.

## PHPDoc array shapes over inline comments

✅ Good — when a property or return value is a structured array, its shape is documented with a PHPDoc array-shape annotation, not an inline comment:

```php
// app/Livewire/Settings/Security.php
/**
 * @var array<int, array{id: int, name: string, authenticator: string|null, created_at_diff: string, last_used_at_diff: string|null}>
 */
#[Locked]
public array $passkeys = [];
```

```php
// app/Livewire/Settings/Security.php
/**
 * @return array{title: string, description: string, buttonText: string}
 */
#[Computed]
public function modalConfig(): array
{
    // ...
}
```

❌ Bad — describing the same shape in a trailing inline comment (adapted to illustrate):

```php
// anti-pattern — do not write this
public array $passkeys = []; // array of {id, name, authenticator, created_at_diff, last_used_at_diff}
```
Array-shape PHPDoc is understood by Larastan and IDEs for static analysis and autocomplete; a prose comment is not.

## Inject single-purpose actions per-method

✅ Good — Fortify/Passkeys action classes are type-hinted directly as method parameters on the Livewire component (Livewire/Laravel resolves them from the container per call), not resolved manually or pulled in through the constructor:

```php
// app/Livewire/Settings/Security.php
public function deletePasskey(DeletePasskey $deletePasskey): void
{
    if (! $this->deletingPasskeyId) {
        return;
    }

    $user = Auth::user();
    $passkey = $user->passkeys()->findOrFail($this->deletingPasskeyId);

    $deletePasskey($user, $passkey);

    $this->closeDeleteModal();
    $this->loadPasskeys();
}
```

The same pattern repeats for `enable(EnableTwoFactorAuthentication ...)`, `disable(DisableTwoFactorAuthentication ...)`, `confirmTwoFactor(ConfirmTwoFactorAuthentication ...)` in the same file, and `deleteUser(Logout $logout)` in `app/Livewire/Settings/DeleteUserForm.php`.

❌ Bad — resolving the action manually inside the method body (adapted to illustrate; not present in the repo):

```php
// anti-pattern — do not write this
public function deletePasskey(): void
{
    $deletePasskey = app(DeletePasskey::class);
    // ...
}
```
Method-parameter injection keeps the dependency visible in the signature (easier to test and to read) and matches every other action call site in this codebase.

### Exception: an action's own dependency is constructor-injected when the method signature is a public contract

Task 0015a's `App\Actions\Auth\EnsureRecentPasswordConfirmation` is used three ways in the same
story, and only one of them follows the rule above:

```php
// app/Actions/Users/UpdateUser.php — constructor injection
public function __construct(
    private readonly EnsureRecentPasswordConfirmation $ensureRecentPasswordConfirmation,
) {}

public function __invoke(User $user, string $name, string $email, string $roleId, UserStatus $status, RequestEmailChange $requestEmailChange): User
{
    // ...
    ($this->ensureRecentPasswordConfirmation)();
}
```

```php
// app/Livewire/Users/Index.php — method injection, the rule above
public function deleteUser(EnsureRecentPasswordConfirmation $ensureRecentPasswordConfirmation): void
{
    // ...
}
```

`UpdateUser` and `CreateUser` constructor-inject it; `Index::deleteUser()` method-injects it. Neither
is arbitrary. `__invoke()`'s parameter list on both actions is a **public contract**, called with
exactly those domain arguments by both `App\Livewire\Users\Index` and every direct-call test (per the
0008a rule that the action must be independently callable) — widening it to also carry the guard as a
parameter would put an internal dependency in a signature callers must match verbatim. `deleteUser()`
has no such external contract (it is a Livewire action method, called only via `wire:click` /
`Livewire::test()->call()`), so the rule above applies unmodified there.

❌ Bad — do not "fix" `UpdateUser`/`CreateUser` to match `deleteUser()`'s shape (adapted to illustrate):

```php
// anti-pattern — do not widen __invoke()'s signature for an internal dependency
public function __invoke(User $user, string $name, string $email, string $roleId, UserStatus $status, RequestEmailChange $requestEmailChange, EnsureRecentPasswordConfirmation $ensureRecentPasswordConfirmation): User
```

A fourth call site, `App\Livewire\Users\Index::requiresPasswordConfirmation()`, resolves the same
class with `app(EnsureRecentPasswordConfirmation::class)` — the ❌ shape above, in the one place it is
actually correct: a `#[Computed]` method takes no parameters at all (Livewire calls it with none), so
neither constructor nor method injection is available, and manual container resolution is the only
option. Don't read this as license to reach for `app()` elsewhere.

Task 0015b repeats the same split for `App\Actions\Auth\LogRefusedPrivilegedAttempt` across seven
classes — constructor-injected into all five domain actions, method-injected into both Livewire
components' action methods — which is the rule and its documented exception applied unchanged, not a
third case. What it does add is the constraint that falls out of the exception:

> **An action must be resolved from the container, never `new`-ed — including in tests.** This story
> gave `RequestEmailChange`, `EnforceAdministratorPermissionGrant` and `EnforceGrantorPermissionScope`
> their **first** constructor dependency, and every existing `new RequestEmailChange` call site broke
> at once: ten of them in `tests/Feature/Settings/EmailChangeTest.php`, each rewritten to
> `app(RequestEmailChange::class)` with no assertion touched. A zero-argument constructor is not a
> contract — the constructor is where this convention says a shared dependency goes, so any action can
> acquire one in a later story.

Task 0017 extends the same split to a third area without altering it — `LogRefusedPrivilegedAttempt` is now constructor-injected into **eight** domain actions and method-injected into **three** Livewire components' action methods — and adds the exception's clearest case yet: **one action depending on another**. `App\Actions\SalesRegions\SetSalesRegionActive` constructor-injects `SetDefaultSalesRegion`, because `__invoke(SalesRegion $region, bool $active, ?SalesRegion $replacementDefault = null)` is a signature every caller — the component and every direct-call test — matches verbatim, so widening it with a collaborator would put an internal dependency into a public contract:

```php
// app/Actions/SalesRegions/SetSalesRegionActive.php
public function __construct(
    private readonly LogRefusedPrivilegedAttempt $logRefusedPrivilegedAttempt,
    private readonly SetDefaultSalesRegion $setDefaultSalesRegion,
) {}
```

❌ Bad — reaching for `app()` here (the shape 0017's own Phase 1 draft proposed before it was corrected):

```php
// anti-pattern — app() is for a zero-parameter #[Computed] method, not for an action's collaborator
($replacement !== null) && app(SetDefaultSalesRegion::class)($replacement);
```

`app()` earns its one exception because a `#[Computed]` method **cannot** accept parameters; an action's constructor is available, so nothing forces the container call. The distinction matters for testability: a constructor dependency can be swapped in a test, an `app()` call inside a method body cannot without binding the container.

Story 0020 adds the exception's **second** shape, which generalises the reason rather than adding a special case. `App\Livewire\Media\Gallery::updatedPendingUploads()` — a Livewire `updated<Property>()` lifecycle hook — resolves two collaborators with `app()` before delegating:

```php
// app/Livewire/Media/Gallery.php
public function updatedPendingUploads(): void
{
    if ($this->pendingUploads === []) {
        return;
    }

    $this->upload(app(StoreUploadedImage::class), app(LogRefusedPrivilegedAttempt::class));
}
```

Livewire invokes lifecycle hooks through `wrap($component)->__call($name, $params)` with **fixed** parameters, not a container `call()`, so a type-hinted parameter here is never resolved. `upload()` itself keeps its ordinary method-injected signature, because it is *also* called directly by every Feature test and **is** container-resolved on that path — the hook is a caller, not a replacement for the signature.

**So the rule is not "a `#[Computed]` method may use `app()`" — it is: a method whose parameter list is fixed by something other than this class may use `app()`, and nothing else may.** Two instances now, a `#[Computed]` property and a lifecycle hook, and both answer the same question the same way: *is there any signature the author controls that the container would honour?* If yes, use it.

Story 0022 reuses `updatedSearch()`'s already-established lifecycle-hook shape (`App\Livewire\Components\SearchableMultiSelect` resolves `NormalizeForSearch` with `app()` there for the identical reason `Gallery::updatedPendingUploads()` does), and adds a **third** shape to the rule rather than a fourth instance of an existing one. `hasSearchedEnough()` is a plain public method — not `#[Computed]`, not a lifecycle hook — called directly from the Blade view with `$this->hasSearchedEnough()`:

```php
// app/Livewire/Components/SearchableMultiSelect.php
public function hasSearchedEnough(): bool
{
    return mb_strlen(app(NormalizeForSearch::class)->__invoke($this->search)) >= $this->minSearchLength;
}
```

```blade
{{-- resources/views/livewire/components/searchable-multi-select.blade.php --}}
@if ($this->hasSearchedEnough())
```

The Blade template's own call site is what fixes the parameter list here — a view invokes `$this->method()` with exactly the arguments it writes, and this one writes none — so the rule's test ("is there any signature the author controls that the container would honour?") answers `no` here for the same underlying reason it answers `no` for a `#[Computed]` property or a lifecycle hook: **the caller is not this class, and the caller cannot be made to pass a dependency.** The rule's own wording — "a method whose parameter list is fixed by something other than this class" — already covered this shape without needing a rewrite; it had simply never had an example that was neither `#[Computed]` nor a lifecycle hook until now.

Story 0029 confirms task 0017's "one action depending on another" case a second time, with a genuine wrinkle: two of the constructor-injected collaborators are pure, dependency-free classes rather than self-authorizing actions. `App\Actions\Products\CreateProductVariant` constructor-injects **four** collaborators — `LogRefusedPrivilegedAttempt`, `TranslateProductVariantUniqueViolation`, `DeriveVariantSku`, `HashVariantCombination` — because `__invoke(Product $product, array $productAttributeValueIds, string $price, int $stock, ?string $featuredMediaId = null)` is, per the 0008a rule, an independently-callable public contract every direct-call test matches verbatim, so none of the four may be added to that signature. `App\Actions\Products\UpdateProduct` constructor-injects `DeriveVariantSku` for the identical reason, as its own `reDeriveVariantSkus()` private method's collaborator — the class's own docblock states explicitly that resolving it via `app()` there would be the anti-pattern this section documents rather than the carve-out, since nothing about that method's parameter list is fixed by anything other than the class itself. A zero-dependency pure function (`HashVariantCombination`, `DeriveVariantSku`) is still container-resolved and constructor-injected like any other collaborator, never `new`-ed — the rule above binds regardless of whether the injected class has dependencies of its own.

✅ Good — how a direct-call test reaches an action, per the 0008a rule that these are independently callable:

```php
// tests/Feature/Settings/EmailChangeTest.php
app(RequestEmailChange::class)($user, 'new-address@example.com');
```

❌ Bad — the shape those ten call sites used until task 0015b:

```php
// anti-pattern — breaks the moment the action gains its first constructor dependency
(new RequestEmailChange)($user, 'new-address@example.com');
```

_Last updated: 2026-09-04 — Story 0029 (Product variants — core backend). Extended the constructor-injection exception's "one action depending on another" confirming instances (task 0017's `SetSalesRegionActive`/`SetDefaultSalesRegion`) with a genuine wrinkle: `CreateProductVariant` constructor-injects four collaborators including two pure, dependency-free classes (`HashVariantCombination`, `DeriveVariantSku`), and `UpdateProduct` constructor-injects `DeriveVariantSku` as its own private re-derivation method's collaborator — its docblock states in writing that `app()` there would be the documented anti-pattern, not the carve-out. The rule is unchanged: a zero-dependency pure function is still container-resolved and constructor-injected like any other collaborator, never `new`-ed. **Verified as unchanged rather than assumed:** every other section on this page — this story adds no new type, brace or PHPDoc-shape convention, and its `ProductVariantValidationRules` trait is the existing validation-trait convention applied, not extended._
